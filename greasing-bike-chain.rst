Greasing the Bike Chain
=======================

Proper chain maintenance is crucial for your bike's performance and longevity. This section guides you through the process of greasing your bike's chain.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting, ensure you have:

* Bike chain lubricant
* Clean rags
* Degreaser (optional)
* Old toothbrush or chain cleaning tool
* Disposable gloves (optional)

For a complete list of recommended maintenance tools, see :ref:`maintenance-toolkit`.





Procedure
---------

Follow these steps to grease your bike chain:

Prepare Your Workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   If you're using a bike stand, refer to :ref:`using-bike-stand` for proper setup.

1. Find a well-ventilated area.
2. Place your bike on a stand or flip it upside down, resting on the seat and handlebars.
3. Put on disposable gloves (optional).

Clean the Chain (if necessary)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the chain is visibly dirty:

    a. Apply degreaser to a clean rag.

    .. figure:: /_img/backup/backup-down-up-control-off.png
        :figwidth: 100 %
        :class: instructionimg

        End of lowering

    b. Hold the rag against the chain while pedaling backward.
    c. Use a brush to remove stubborn grime.
    d. Wipe with a clean, dry rag.

    .. uml:: 

        @startuml
        start
        :Select Recovery Mode, then press Reset;
        if (Recovery Engaged?) then (yes)
        :Open Hoist Brake;
        :Use Recovery Drive to lower/raise Load;
        stop
        @enduml

For detailed cleaning instructions, see :ref:`deep-cleaning-chain`.

Apply Lubricant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Shake the lubricant bottle well.
2. While pedaling backward, apply a thin stream of lubricant to the chain's inner side.
3. Continue until the entire chain is lubricated.

.. warning::
   Avoid over-lubrication, as excess lubricant attracts dirt.

Remove Excess Lubricant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Let the lubricant sit for a few minutes.
2. Wipe off excess with a clean, dry rag.
3. Continue wiping while pedaling backward.

Final Check
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Inspect the chain for even lubrication.
2. Pedal and shift through all gears to distribute lubricant.
