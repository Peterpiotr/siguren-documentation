Introduction
=============

The MS Unit (referred to for short MS) is a proprietary system for the protection of the hoist load from mechanical or electrical failure and overspeed, 
and for the recovery of the load in the event of a failure. The unit is supplied with a proprietary control panel from the equipment manufacturers. 
The crane’s hardwired controls are interfaced to this panel to control the MotoSuiveur® in normal operation. 

The MS Unit is a failsafe mechanical hoist arrester, designed and manufactured by Siguren Technologies LTD. 
The MS Unit protects against failures in hoist drive trains that would otherwise lead to dropped loads or overloads.

MS Unit provides mechanical failsafe protection in the event of any electrica or mechanical failure of the hoist drive train. 
In addition to the MS Unit, a MS Torque Limiter is put in the drive-train to limit any overload into the hoist lifting mechanism.

The MS unit is a failsafe mechanical hoist arrester, designed and manufactured by Siguren. 
The MS unit protects against failures in hoist drive trains that would otherwise lead to dropped loads or overloads.  
The MS consists of an irreversible worm and wheel gearbox mounted directly to the hoist drum. It is a permissive system which allows 
the drum to rotate at any speed within the hoist’s normal operating parameters. 

Under fault conditions a differential speed between the worm and wheel will cause the system to mechanically lock and the damping system safely arrests the load. 

This provides mechanical failsafe protection in the event of any electro-mechanical failure of the hoist drive train. 

The typical arrangement is shown in Figure 1 below. In addition to the unit, a torque limiter is put in the drive-train to limit the maximum load into the MS unit. 

The MS units are available in multiple variants; hydraulic damping or friction plate arresting, shaft mounted or foot mounted each with various load capacities.

 The units are available in sizes 0 to 8 which equate to increasing equivalent drum loads. 
 
 The subject of this document is the MS size 3 – hydraulic version, which is capable of braking torques of 32.0kN each with the barrel rotating at up to 30rpm (based 
 on 120% over-speed limit of 36rpm)
