The MS wheel is internally splined and is connected to a splined shaft attached to the crane drive train to transmit torque via plain bearings 
between the shaft and wheel to support the interface radially. 
The wheel interface consists of a plain bearing mounted between the wheel and casing for radial support where the wheel interacts directly 
with the casing for lateral and axial loads. 

The worm and wheel interact in a standard manner, with the mesh such that clearance is achieved and that the wheel cannot force rotation on to the worm. 
The worm bears onto the casing directly and is supported laterally and radially. 
Axial restraint is provided by spring which holds the worm in place where the normal servo motor torque is applied (i.e., under normal conditions). 
Extending from the worm in one direction is a shaft with a splined surface, this interfaces with a bevel gear with an internal spline and is axially free to translate 
along the worm shaft. Meshing with the bevel gear is its reciprocal gear, which is rigidly fixed to a servo motor, itself mounted to the casing. 
This motor provides rotation to the worm via the bevel gear arrangement at a pre-set torque. The worm conveys this torque onto the wheel through its mesh. 
The motor is actuated when the hoist operation is requested. When the servo motor actuates it allows the worm to convey the torque onto the wheel,
but this torque is insufficient to allow the crane drive to actuate, instead allowing the wheel to rotate with the drum shaft through the normal crane drive. 
Finally, to complete the moment couple between the drum shaft and the MS Unit, a dowel pins mounts between the torque arm and the hoist body.
