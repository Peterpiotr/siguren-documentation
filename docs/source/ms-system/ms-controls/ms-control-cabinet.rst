Nameplate
----------

MS Control Cabinet have nameplate located on front side of the door indicating input power (voltage, frequency, current), serial number, date.

The nameplate of the MS Control Cabinet indicates model, serial number, date of production, voltage / power requirements.
Exemplary general appearance of MS Control Cabinet nameplate shown on figure below.

Architecture of a MotoSuiveurÂ® System
======================================================

	Hoist-MS Control Signals

In the standalone architecture, the MS Controller receives only inputs from the main hoist control panel, 
basically [ðŸ”¼ Up] and [ðŸ”½ Down] on terminal block T2. 

Terminal block T4 is a set of digital outputs (relays) providing MotoSuiveurÂ® status information, as well as an enable signal for operation, 
enabling upward and downward movement signals.

Terminal blocks T3, T5\*\, T6, T7 and T8 are analog and digital inputs for MotoSuiveurÂ® standalone system.

On figure below is presented the architecture of the MotoSuiveurÂ® Solution.

.. lines are crossing and confusing the drawing. MS is not red. update illustration

Integration of the MotoSuiveurÂ® System in the hoist control system
=====================================================================

The integration of the MotoSuiveurÂ® System into the control system of a new or existing hoist is done by pre-configuring the MS I/O interface. 

All electrical parameters and iterfaces are specified by the pre-configuration diagram.

.. why "pre-configuration" and not "configuration". say that its because it is done in the feasibility study?
