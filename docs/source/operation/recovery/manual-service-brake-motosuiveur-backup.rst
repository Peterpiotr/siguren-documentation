Manual Service Brake and MS Backup Procedure
=============================================

.. important::
  This procedure has to be followed in case of one MS Unit servo motor is defective.

.. clarify

The load lowering movement is controlled manually by operator, through the handle at the MS shaft.

Each of the two operators can stop the operation: the first operator by closing the service brake, the second operator by stopping the rotation of MS Unit.

During this procedure, the lowering is controlled by the operator on the service brake. The other operator follows the movement and can always stop it.


Preliminary steps
    1. Second operator is required to control main hoist brake. 
    2. MotoSuiveur® System power should be switched off in MS Control Cabinet. Switch off power of MS Control Cabinet (The MS Unit should be driven manually).

Steps
	1. Dismantle the worm cover of the MS Unit.

	5. The operator n°1 opens the service brake step by step (to allow the lowering of the load by gravity without exceeding a certain speed, in which case the MS blocks). Meanwhile, the other operator n°2 should follow the movement by rotating the handle.
