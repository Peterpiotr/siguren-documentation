Using the MotoSuiveurÂ® system recovery capabilities
====================================================

The MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit will never allow a load drop. It will arrest the hoist drum whenever the hoist brake is unable to do so. 
However, the MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit can be used as a gearbox to lower and even raise the load. 

.. note::
	The MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit is irreversible â€“ meaning that load drop is impossible even when the MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit alone is used for recovering the load. 
	This allows the user to use the weight of the load without risking a load drop.

Three main methods can be used (and combined) to recover the load, depending on how the hoist brake 
and the MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit can be accessed and used in the emergency situation that requires the recovery:

- :ref:`Forced MS recovery`
- :ref:`MS followed gravity lowering`
- :ref:`MS assisted gravity lowering`


Forced MotoSuiveurÂ® recovery
-----------------------------

With the hoist brake open and the MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit holding the load, rotate the MS worm shaft with considerable torque. 
In this situation the MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit moves the load.
This way, a very high amount of torque must be applied on the MS shaft (approximately 1/8 of the barrel torque).

Using the following hardware:

- :doc:`Portable Recovery Tool <../../equipment/ms-solution/rec-addons>` for sizes MS4 - MS7, or
- :doc:`Handheld Recovery Tool <../../equipment/ms-solution/rec-addons>` for sizes MS0 - MS3

For MS with Integrated Load Recovery the hardware is integrated and is remotely operated.

Steps
  1. Open the hoist brake
  2. Rotate the worm shaft **only in anticlockwise direction** with the **following torque** to lower the SWL. 
  3. Maximum values shown in `Forced MS Recovery method max torques`.

Integrated Recovery System 
==========================

When deciding a recovery with MotoSuiveurÂ® Integrated Recovery System is required to be undertaken an assessment should be made to establish where the fault has occurred. 
MotoSuiveurÂ® Integrated Recovery System can only be used if the hoist is mechanical drive chain is not blocked by a mechanical means such as 
hoist gearbox failure or main hoist (service) brake failure.  
In the event the failure does permit the recovery the procedure describes the process to be undertaken to complete the 
recovery utilising the integrated MotoSuiveurÂ® recovery system.

Whilst undertaking the recovery process and in all cases the main motor hoist service brake is required to be operable and correctly functioning. 
Ð¢his will then be required to be opened (automatically or manually) for the entire duration of the recovery starting from when the Integrated Recovery System is engaged.

The purpose of the Integrated Recovery System is to provide an independent means of enabling the raising or lowering the load in the event of a failure of the main hoisting mechanism.
This means of hoisting is achieved and initiated from the MotoSuiveurÂ® System control cabinet with physical switches. 

.. important::
	Prior to any recovery operations commencing, the cause of the fault should be identified.

Steps
  1. Activating Recovery mode 
     
  Activate Recovery mode by following steps in :doc:`Automatic recovery engagement procedure <../../operation/recovery/automatic-recovery-engagement>`

  2. Recovery lowering

  After successful engagement, the recovery procedure can begin. To start lowering following actions are:

  2.1 Open hoist maun brake.

  2.2 Turning the :guilabel:`Recovery Mode Down/Up`` switch to position **Down** .

  2.3 Lowering continues until the load has reached a safe location for detached from the hoist.

  .. figure:: /_img/recovery/recovery-down.png
  	:figwidth: 600 px
  	:class: instructionimg

  	Turning switch to position Down

  1. Complete recovery lowering

  When safe location is reached and load is detouched, the :guilabel:`Recovery Mode Down/Up` switch should be turned to the neutral position.
  Hoist main (service) brake has to **close**.

  .. figure:: /_img/recovery/recovery-neutral-position.png
  	:figwidth: 600 px
  	:class: instructionimg

  	Turning switch to neutral position

  1. Recentering worm shaft

  After detaching load, worm shaft recentering between limit switches is required. 
  Centering is performed:

  4.1 With hoist main brake closed downward movement with Integrated Recovey System is required.

  .. figure:: /_img/recovery/recovery-down.png
  	:figwidth: 600 px
  	:class: instructionimg

  	Turning switch to position Down for recentering

  4.2 Movement continues until :guilabel:`ðŸŸ¢ Upward Enabled` and :guilabel:`ðŸŸ¢ Downward Enabled` indicator lights are both iluminated.

  	Recentering of worm shaft


  1. Exit form Recovery mode

  5.1 Worm shaft is located between limit switches.

  5.2 Short **upward** movement with Recovery System is required for disengaging Recovery Mechanism from worm shaft.

  Switch :guilabel:`Recovery Mode Down/Up` to position **UP** for 2 - 5 seconds. After that switch to **neutral position**.

  5.3 Turnin :guilabel:`ðŸ”‘ Recovery Mode Off | On` switch to the position **OFF** 

  .. figure:: /_img/recovery/recovery-switch-off.png
  	:figwidth: 200 px
  	:class: instructionimg

  	Switch off Recovery mode

  5.4 Reset MotoSuiveurÂ® System
