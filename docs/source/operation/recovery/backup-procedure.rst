Backup mode is available is intended to allow hoist movements in some special situations. 
This :guilabel:`ðŸ”‘ Backup Mode Off/On` allows the user to lower or raise the load with the MS Unit ensuring no braking occurs. It does
this via the MS Unit servo motor following the hoist movement whilst maintaining the normal position for the worm.

The hoist crane and MotoSuiveurÂ® System are controlled in the same way as in Follow mode - from the hoist control panel. 
The MotoSuiveurÂ® System can also be equipped with a switch that duplicates the signals from the hoist - :guilabel:`Backup mode Down/Up`.

When Backup mode is activated:
- The MS Unit motor speed is physically limited 
- All MotoSuiveurÂ® System logic faults (over speed etc) are inhibited.
- "Hoist Enabled" signal is forced.
- MS Unit limit switches are inhibited.
- The MS Unit motor speed is physically limited to 110% during normal operation.
- Hoist enable signals are ignored.
