Backup mode is available is intended to allow hoist movements in some special situations. 
This :guilabel:`ðŸ”‘ BACKUP MODE OFF / ON` allows the user to lower or raise the load with the MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit ensuring no braking occurs. It does
this via the MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit servo motor following the hoist movement whilst maintaining the normal position for the worm.

The hoist crane and MotoSuiveurÂ® System are controlled in the same way as in Follow mode - from the hoist control panel. 
The MotoSuiveurÂ® System can also be equipped with a switch that duplicates the signals from the hoist - :guilabel:`BACKUP MODE DOWN/UP`.

When Backup mode is activated:

- The MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit motor speed is physically limited 
- All MotoSuiveurÂ® System logic faults (overspeed, etc.) are inhibited.
- "Hoist Enabled" signal is forced.
- MotoSuiveurÂ® Unit limit switches are inhibited.
- Hoist enable signals are ignored.
