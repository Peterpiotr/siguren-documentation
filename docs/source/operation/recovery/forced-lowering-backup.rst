Recovery by Forced Lowering Procedure
=====================================

This procedure is necessary when the main kinematic chain is not available due to gearbox or transmission shaft breakage.

   :depth: 2

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting, ensure you have:

* A mechanism to drive the MS worm
* Sufficient torque to move the load (considering weight and friction)
* Appropriate tools for recovery:
    * `Handheld Recovery Tool (MS-HRT) <https://www.siguren.com/product/handheld-recovery-tool-hrt#menu>`_ for MotoSuiveur速 Systems size MS0 - MS4
    * `Portable Recovery Tool (MS-PRT) <https://www.siguren.com/product/ms-prt#menu>`_ for MotoSuiveur速 Systems size MS5 - MS7

For a complete list of recovery tools, see :ref:`recovery-tools-guide`.

.. note::
   Only one operator is needed for this procedure.

.. warning::
   This procedure should be done as a last resort. Prioritize other backup procedures, as forced lowering causes rapid wear to the worm and wheel.

Forced Lowering Procedure
-------------------------

Follow these steps to perform the forced lowering procedure:

Prepare the MS Unit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Switch off power to the MS Control Cabinet.
2. Dismantle the worm cover of the MS Unit.

      Installation of Portable Recovery Tool (MS-PRT)

Perform Lowering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Start the lowering process.
2. Continue lowering until the load is safely on the ground or an adapted structure.

For detailed instructions on operating the recovery tools, see :ref:`recovery-tool-operation-guide`.

Post-Lowering Inspection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Once the load is safe, inspect the MotoSuiveur速 (worm and wheel) and the hoist.

.. warning::
   A detailed inspection of the MS Unit (worm and wheel) and the hoist is mandatory after lowering is complete!
