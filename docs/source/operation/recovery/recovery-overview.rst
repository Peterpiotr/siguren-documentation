The MS Unit will never allow a load drop. It will arrest the hoist drum whenever the hoist brake is unable to do so. 
However, the MS Unit can be used as a gearbox to lower and even raise the load. 

.. note::
	The MS Unit is irreversible – meaning that load drop is impossible even when the MS Unit alone is used for recovering the load. 
	This allows the user to use the weight of the load without risking a load drop.

Three main methods can be used (and combined) to recover the load, depending on how the hoist brake 
and the MS Unit can be accessed and used in the emergency situation that requires the recovery:

- Forced MS recovery
- MS followed gravity lowering
- MS assisted gravity lowering

Forced MotoSuiveur® Recovery
----------------------------

With the hoist brake open and the MS Unit holding the load, rotate the MS worm shaft with considerable torque. 
In this situation the MS Unit moves the load.
This way, a very high amount of torque must be applied on the MS shaft (approximately 1/8 of the barrel torque).

Using the following hardware:

- :doc:`Portable Recovery Tool </equipment/ms-solution/rec-addons>` for sizes MS4 - MS7, or
- :doc:`Handheld Recovery Tool </equipment/ms-solution/rec-addons>` for sizes MS0 - MS3

For MS with Integrated Load Recovery the hardware is integrated and is remotely operated.

Steps
  1. Open the hoist brake
  2. Rotate the worm shaft **only in anticlockwise direction** with the **following torque** to lower the SWL. 
  3. Maximum values shown in `Forced MS Recovery method max torques`.
