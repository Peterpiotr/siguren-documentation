This procedure is applicable in case the kinematic chains are operational (hoist is healthy) but other types of faults appear (repetitive faults, incorrect settings, etc.). 
It allows moving the load at a certain position at slow speed.

.. note::
  Only one operator is needed for this procedure.

Instruction
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Activate :doc:`Backup Mode <../../operation/recovery/backup-procedure>`.
2. Move at low speed (up or down) by operating on the hoist control.
3. Once the move is complete, it is necessary to identify and resolve the causes that have caused need to use Backup Mode.
4. Deactivate :doc:`Backup Mode <../../operation/recovery/backup-procedure>`.
       
.. note::       
  If limit speed is reached, MotoSuiveurÂ® System goes into action intrinsically by blocking the worm **without fault occurrence**.
