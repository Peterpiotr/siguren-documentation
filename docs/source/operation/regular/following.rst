Following operation mode is the main operating mode of the MotoSuiveurÂ® system.
Following operation mode starts after successful passed of selfâ€“test. 
The function of Following mode is intended for follow movements of the hoist/crane and to monitor 
for exceeding the :term:`rated speed` with defined positive tolerance. 
The speed, which is considered high is called :term:`overspeed`. 

It is separated into Rest and Follow states. 
At Rest, MotoSuiveurÂ® system is waiting for a movement request.  
When a movement request is received, MotoSuiveurÂ® system starts following.
Rest and Following states are displayed on `MS Controller 7-segment display`_ and :doc:`MSHMI <../../equipment/control-interface/ms-hmi>` "Main Screen" field "MS system status:".

    By design MotoSuiveurÂ® system **will not allow** overspeed. 

Following operation mode principle
====================================

After successful passed of selfâ€“test MotoSuiveurÂ® system is in Rest.
In Rest, after a successful self-test and the presence of an enable signal from the crane, 
the following indicators are active - :guilabel:`ðŸŸ¢ Hoist enabled`, :guilabel:`ðŸŸ¢ Upward Enable` and :guilabel:`ðŸŸ¢ Downward Enable`.

.. _Active indicators in following state:

   :figwidth: 600 px

   Active indicators in following state

The following process is started after pressing the buttons to operate the hoist up or down. 
If a limit switch prohibiting upward movement is activated during movement, the :guilabel:`ðŸŸ¢ Upward Enable` indicator becomes inactive - :numref:`Upward movement prohibited`. 
In this state, no upward movement of the crane is allowed, and a short downward movement is required until the MS worm is cantered :numref:`Active indicators in following state`.

.. _Upward movement prohibited:
.. figure:: ../../_img/Regular-operations/indicators-following-state.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 600 px

   Upward movement prohibited

Accordingly, if the limit switch prohibiting downward movement is activated during movement, the :guilabel:`ðŸŸ¢ Downward Enable` indicator becomes inactive â€“ :numref:`Downward movement prohibited`. 
In this state, no downward movement of the crane is allowed, and a short upward movement is required until the MS worm is cantered â€“ :numref:`Active indicators in following state`.

.. _Downward movement prohibited:
.. figure:: ../../_img/Regular-operations/downward-prohibited.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 600 px

   Downward movement prohibited

If the enable signal from the hoist to MotoSuiveurÂ® system loss, the :guilabel:`ðŸŸ¢ Hoist enabled` indicator becomes inactive. 
In this case MotoSuiveurÂ® system does not follow the hoist on a motion request. 
Accordingly, MotoSuiveurÂ® system does not provide an Enable signal to hoist.

.. _No enable signal from hoist:
.. figure:: ../../_img/Regular-operations/no-enable-signal.png
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 600 px

   No enable signal from hoist

The states described above do not put the MotoSuiveurÂ® system in a fault state. 
Fault states can occur for a variety of reasons (overspeed detection, unwanted movement detection, loss of power supply etc.). 
When the hoist is requested to move, the MC starts to follow in the direction it is required. 
During following, the MC checks for exceeding the maximum permissible hoist speed. 
When the MotoSuiveurÂ® system detects that the defined speed is exceeded, it trips, :guilabel:`ðŸ”´ Fault indicator` became active, 
Hoist enabled indicator became inactive and prevents the hoist from moving. 
Downward enable and Upward enable are ignored in fault state.
Fault message is displayed on MS Controller 7-segmend display and MSHMI.

   MotoSuiveurÂ® system fault state
   
After MotoSuiveurÂ® system enters a fault state, an operator (authorized personnel) response is required to identify the reason for the fault. 
Once the cause of the failure has been identified and resolved, a :doc:`Reset <../../operation/regular/system-reset>` of the MotoSuiveurÂ® system is required. 
After a successful self-test following a reset of MS system, it enters in following mode.

Figure :numref:`Main principle of following operation mode and overspeed detection` 
present the main principle of Following operation mode (upper part) and Overspeed detection (lower part). 
MotoSuiveurÂ® system follows hoist/crane movement until overspeed is detected.
When overspeed is detected, MotoSuiveurÂ® system **trips** and mechanicaly lockes hoist/crane
to prevent load drop.
