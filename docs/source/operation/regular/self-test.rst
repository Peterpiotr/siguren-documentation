     Description refers to software version 8.2.


A self-test is a procedure in which the MotoSuiveur unit tests its health through a sequence of tests. 
The self-test is performed after the initial power-up of the MotoSuiveur system or after a restart from the Reset button on the electrical panel.
Sequence of Self-test operations are displayed on MS controller 7 â€“ segment display.

In table below self-test sequence is shown.
