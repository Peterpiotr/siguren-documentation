.. note::
     Description refers to software version 8.2.


A self-test is a procedure in which the MotoSuiveur unit tests its health through a sequence of tests. 
The self-test is performed after the initial power-up of the MotoSuiveur system or after a restart from the Reset button on the electrical panel.
Sequence of Self-test operations are displayed on MS controller 7 â€“ segment display.

In table below self-test sequence is shown.

Any warnings and faults that occur during MotoSuiveur system operation are displayed on the HMI screen (if installed) and on the 7-segment display of the MS controller. 
Each fault is characterized by a number and a description. Faults are divided into two groups - system faults (in result of MS controller internal check) 
and MotoSuiveur system faults. 
System faults are those that are related to the electrical performance of the MS controller or mechanical. 
MotoSuiveur system faults are related to the working process of the MS unit.
Indication of warning or fault on MS Controller 7-segment display is a combination of letter and numbers. 
MS controller internal faults are indicated with blinked combination of |image035| , number and finish with symbol |image039|.
MS faults are displayed with combination of |image036| and number. MS warnings are displayed with combination of |image035| and number.
