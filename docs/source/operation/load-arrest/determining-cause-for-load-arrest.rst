==================================
Determining Cause for Load Arrest
==================================

Introduction 
=============

The causes leading to a load arrest by the MotoSuiveurÂ® System can be:

	- Electrical or mechanical failure of the **hoist motor brake**.
	- Electrical or mechanical failure of the **hoist motor**.
	- Mechanical failure of the **hoist gearbox**.
	- Electrical failure of the **hoist controls** or the **MS Controls**.

        Load Arrest by a Hydraulic Damping MS Unit

.. this image is helpful how? better with numbers?

..    In case of load arrest action is required. Operator (authorized personnel) should identify reason for load arrest. Possible the presence of an Fault.

Root Cause Analysis 
=====================

.. how can the user use MS Controller display or HMI or just logic to find out why arrest occured
.. maybe deduce it from the timing of the arrest, the speed, acceleration, direction, 
.. could we display top acceleration on HMI?
.. special case for Overspeed-induced arrests?
