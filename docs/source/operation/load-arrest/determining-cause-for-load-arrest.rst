Determining Cause for Load Arrest
==================================

.. The MS Unit is a failsafe **mechanical** hoist arrester.

MS Unit protects against failures in hoist drive trains that would otherwise lead to dropped loads or overloads.

The reasons for MotoSuiveurÂ® System load arrest can be various such as:
	- electrical or mechanical failure of the hoist motor brake;
	- electrical or mechanical failure of the hoist motor;
	- mechanical failure of the hoist reducer;
	- electrical failure of the hoist control or the MC system;
