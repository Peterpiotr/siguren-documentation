==================================
Determining Cause for Load Arrest
==================================

.. The MotoSuiveur速 Unit is a failsafe **mechanical** hoist arrester.

MotoSuiveur速 Unit protects against failures in hoist drive trains that would otherwise lead to dropped loads or overloads.

The reasons for MotoSuiveur速 system load arrest can be various such as:
	- electrical or mechanical failure of the hoist motor brake;
	- electrical or mechanical failure of the hoist motor;
	- mechanical failure of the hoist reducer;
	- electrical failure of the hoist control or the MC system;

..    In case of load arrest action is required. Operator (authorized personnel) should identify reason for load arrest. Possible the presence of an Fault.
