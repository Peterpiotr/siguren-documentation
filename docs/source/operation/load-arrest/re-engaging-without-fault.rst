========================================================

It is possible to have load arrest with and without the presence of fault.
In both case of load arrest Unscrewing enable switch is actuated. :guilabel:`游릭 Downward Enable` light indicator is **not** illuminated.

Steps
	1. Cause of the load arrest has been identified and eliminated.
	2. Hoist is healthy.
	3. Enable signal to MotoSuiveur춽 system from hoist is on.
	4. :guilabel:`游릭 Hoist Enabled` signal from MotoSuiveur춽 system to hoist is on*.
	5. Short upward movement is necessary (from hoist control) until :guilabel:`游릭 Downward Enable` light swiches to illuminated.
	6. Both light indicators :guilabel:`游릭 Downward Enable` and :guilabel:`游릭 Upward Enable` are illuminated.
	7. MotoSuiveur춽 system is ready to follow.

\*\ If :guilabel:`游릭 Hoist Enabled` signal is not illuminated, :guilabel:`游댐 Enable Override` should be used to force signal.
Forced signal should be used **only** for movement performing.
