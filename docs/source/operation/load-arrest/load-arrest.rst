Load arrest
============

The MotoSuiveur Unit is a failsafe **mechanical** hoist arrester. 
MotoSuiveur Unit protects against failures in hoist drive trains that would otherwise lead to dropped loads or overloads.
The reasons for MotoSuiveur system load arrest can be various such as:

- electrical or mechanical failure of the hoist motor brake;
- electrical or mechanical failure of the hoist motor;
- mechanical failure of the hoist reducer;
- electrical failure of the hoist control or the MC system;
- other reason.
