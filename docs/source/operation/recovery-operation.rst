The MS will never allow a load drop. It will arrest the hoist drum whenever the hoist brake is unable to do so. 
However, the MS can be used as a gearbox to lower and even raise the load. 

.. note::
	The MS is irreversible ‚Äì meaning that load drop is impossible even when the MS alone is used for recovering the load. 
	This allows the user to use the weight of the load without risking a load drop.

Three main methods can be used (and combined) to recover the load, depending on how the hoist brake 
and the MotoSuiveur Unit can be accessed and used in the emergency situation that requires the recovery:

- :ref:`Forced MS recovery`
- :ref:`MS followed gravity lowering`
- :ref:`MS assisted gravity lowering`


Forced MS recovery
-------------------

With the hoist brake open and the MotoSuiveur Unit holding the load, rotate the MS :mechpart:`worm shaft` with considerable torque. 
In this situation the MotoSuiveur Unit moves the load.
This way, a very high amount of torque must be applied on the MS shaft (approximately 1/8 of the barrel torque).

Using the following hardware:

- :doc:`Portable Recovery Tool` for sizes MS4 - MS7, or
- :doc:`Handheld Recovery Tool` for sizes MS0 - MS3

For MS with :doc:`Integrated Remote Recovery` the hardware is integrated and is remotely operated.

Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-	Open the hoist brake
-	Rotate the :mechpart:`worm shaft` with the following torque to lower the SWL (maximum values)

.. csv-table:: Forced MS Recovery method max torques
   :file: tables/forcedRecoveryTorque.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: tight-table

.. important::
	Indicative barrel speed: 0.1 - 0.3 rpm


MS followed gravity lowering
-------------------------------

Step lowering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
	This method can be used only with Hydraulic Damping MS.

.. "method" vs "procedure" vs ...

- Pulse the hoist brake (manually or electrically) to lower the load a few centimeters. The MS :mechpart:`worm shaft` will shift toward the damping chamber. The electrical or brake lever pulse must be short enough to not allow the worm to reach the :mechpart:`elastomer` at the bottom of the damping chamber. 
- Then it is possible to return the :mechpart:`worm shaft` to its ‚Äúcentered‚Äù position by hand. 
- Repeat this until the load reaches the floor.

This way, very low torque applied on the MS shaft will be needed (approximately 1/5000 of the barrel torque). 
Using handwheel / crank handle or standard ratchet handle.

The MS can automatically follow if switched to Backup Mode. 
This negates the need of manual operation at the :mechpart:`worm shaft`. 
In case of power outage, the MS can be UPS/battery operated.
Furthermore, the MS can control the brake opening / closing, thus making the gravity load recovery automated.

	Hydraulic Damping MS step lowering

-	Pulse the hoist brake to achieve less than 30 degrees barrel rotation by gravity
-	Rotate the :mechpart:`worm shaft` by hand few rotations to centralize it
-	Repeat

.. important::
	Indicative mean barrel speed: 0.5 rpm


Backup Mode gravity lowering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Switch the MS to :doc:`backup-recovery-mode`,
- Order lowering. 
- Progressively release the motor brake using the provided :mechpart:`Brake Release Tool`, until the load starts to rotate the barrel. 
- Use the Brake Release Tool to regulate and maintain the speed below the specified safe speed. A :guilabel:`üîä buzzer` will sound when the safe speed is close.

The MS will arrest the barrel if:

-	lowering order is removed or
-	overspeed is reached

After such arrest, the worm shaft can be returned to its ‚Äúcentered‚Äù position by using a standard wrench.

In case of power outage, the MS can be UPS/battery operated.

- Progressively untighten the motor brake, using the :mechpart:`Brake Release Tool`, until the load starts to rotate the barrel. 
- Use the Brake Release Tool to regulate and maintain the speed below the specified safe speed. A :guilabel:`üîä buzzer` will sound when the safe speed is close.

.. important::
	Indicative barrel speed: 2 - 5 rpm


MS assisted gravity lowering
--------------------------------

- Apply moderate torque to the MS :mechpart:`worm shaft`. 
- Progressively release the motor brake, using the provided Brake Release Tool, until the load starts to rotate the barrel. 
- The barrel stops when no torque is applied to the MS :mechpart:`worm shaft`.

In this scenario, only moderate torque is to be applied to the MS :mechpart:`worm shaft` (approximately 1/250 of the barrel torque).

Using the following hardware:
- Handheld Recovery Tool for MS sizes above MS4,
- Handwheel / crank handle or standard ratchet handle for sizes MS0 ‚Äì MS3

Recovery Procedure
=======================

.. note::
	Source is :doc:`49104-15-001 Operation  Maintenance Manual Issue D (1).pdf`

The MotoSuiveur unit is a proprietary system for protection of the main hoist load from over-speed and
load path failures, and for recovery of the load in the event of a failure. The MotoSuiveur unit is supplied
with a proprietary control panel from the equipment manufacturers. The crane hardwired controls are
interfaced to this panel to control the MotoSuiveur in normal operation.

A separate operator panel, the MS remote panel, is provided, located adjacent the crane operator panel,
which houses the MotoSuiveur recovery controls and MotoSuiveur HMI. In the event of a protection
system trip, caused by main hoist over-height or main hoist over-load, the crane operator will require the
use of the recovery procedure.

Prior to any recovery operations commencing, the cause of the fault should be identified. The following
procedure below explains the recovery procedure process.

     - **Using the isolator move this into the normal positon by applying 400v to the panel.**
   * - **17**
     - As soon as the panel is energised the drive will initiate a self-test and start the HMI software. 
   * - **18**
     - The self-test will complete and the :guilabel:`üü¢ Enable Lamp` will be illuminated.

.. important::
  | Recovery Limitations:
  | **Downward direction**: Full SWL and locked service brake only. Service brake should be opened during recovery.
  | **Upward direction**: Limited to 3.5t hook block only without load applied and brake operable. Upward movement with SWL and Hoist brake closed is not permitted.


Using of the recovery system 
==============================

.. note::
	Source: :download:`User Manual-7.4.doc`

The purpose of the recovery system is to lower the load on a safe place if a component of the overall lifting equipment is damaged or unavailable.

.. important::
  The system has to be used only by trained and authorized workers.
  The procedures must be correctly followed to avoid damaging the equipment.

The following table shows the procedure to follow in each case of failure.

   * - **1**
     - | **On the Main control panel, select ‚ÄúRecovery mode‚Äù on the ‚ÄúNormal mode‚Äù to ‚ÄúRecovery mode‚Äù selection button.**
       | When selecting ‚ÄúRecovery mode‚Äù, the Proface touch screen turns automatically to the ‚ÄúEngagement screen‚Äù (see Recovery procedure with the Proface for more details).
   * - **2**
     - | Engaging the clutch(es) of the recovery motor(s).
       | The engagement procedure is done automatically by the Siguren control panel logics. 
       | 
       | .. important::
       |   If the ‚Äú Clutch engaged‚Äù light is already on, jump to next step.
       | 
       | Otherwise, on the Siguren control panel, press and release the :guilabel:`‚ÄúEngagement‚Äù push button`.
       | On the Proface touch screen, the blinking :guilabel:`orange light` indicates that the Motosuiveur¬Æ is proceeding with the engagement.
       | On installations with 2 recovery motors, the engagement procedure is performed one after the other. Any modification on these settings requires level 4 password.
       |
       | The duration of the engagement cycle is set in the ‚Äúrecovery settings‚Äù menu by the manufacturer. It is typically set between 1 to 3 minutes per recovery motor.
       |
       | The clutch(es) of the recovery motor(s) is/are engaged when the ‚ÄúRecovery available‚Äù light of the Siguren control panel switches on.

       | On the Proface, the engagement light turns to permanent green. A button appears on the right handside bottom to allow the visualization of the recovery operation screen.
   * - **3**
     - If the engagement process fails, it could be for one of the following reasons:
      
       - At least one controller of the recovery motor(s) is not working,
       - Recovery motors power is not turned on,
       - The engagement procedure is stopped by time out 
      
       .. rubric:: Issue with recovery motors
         **Make sure the recovery controllers are running properly.**
         **Make sure the recovery motors are powered on.**
      
       .. rubric:: Engagement process time-out
         If the engagement is not completed before the cycle timeout, the ‚Äúengagement‚Äù light on the control panel does not turn on, the :guilabel:`engagement status light` turns to permanent red.
         The engagement failure may come from a short setting of the engagement cycle timeout delay. If the engagement procedure fails due to timeout, it is possible to repeat the procedure again from STEP 2.
         After many failed trials, verify that the recovery motor(s) operate(s) correctly.
         See ‚Äúpotential reasons for an engagement failure‚Äù paragraph next page.

     - | It is possible to perform recovery operations if and only if the recovery motor(s) is/are engaged.
       | **On the Siguren control panel, turn the selection button to ‚ÄúRecovery down‚Äù to lower the load on the floor (or on a safe area).**
       |
       | .. important::
       |   It is possible to hoist the load up if necessary. But avoid hoisting the maximum load up with the recovery facility during more than 1 minute.
       |   Also make sure that the service brake is open during this movement. If it is not the case, it is mandatory to lower the load. 
       |   If this condition is not respected, the equipment could be damaged.
       |
       | **When the load touches the floor, release the** :guilabel:`‚Äúrecovery down‚Äù selection button` of the Siguren control panel.
       | Remove the load from the hook.
       | On the Siguren control panel, select ‚ÄúRecovery up‚Äù. This action disengages the clutch(es). ‚ÄúRecovery available‚Äù light should turn off. 
       | In the recovery control box, press the push button ‚ÄúRecovery up‚Äù to disengage the nut. Check that the ‚ÄúNut engaged‚Äù lamp switches off and the ‚ÄúNut disengaged‚Äù lamp switches on.

.. note::
  At the end of this procedure the Motosuiveur¬Æ screw is locked in the elastomers in the lift side. 
  With the main hoisting motor, make a 1 second movement at low speed in the down direction to unlock the screw.

.. important::
  The power supply of the equipment must be cut before any maintenance operation.
  Do not power up the equipment until the failed component has been fixed or changed.

.. warning::
  The recovery feature is designed to be used as an exceptional hoisting solution.
  Lengthy and/or repetitive use of the recovery facility can cause excessive wear of the Motosuiveur¬Æ.
