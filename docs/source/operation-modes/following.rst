Following operation mode
=========================

Following operation mode starts after successful passed of self–test. 
The function of this operation mode is intended for follow movements of the hoist and to monitor 
for exceeding the rated speed (nominal speed) with defined positive tolerance. 
The speed, which is considered high is called Overspeed. By design MS will not allow Overspeed. 
Typically Overspeed is equal to:
Overspeed = Nominal speed + 10%
