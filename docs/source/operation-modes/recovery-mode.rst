Recovery mode is second part of Backup/Recovery operation. 

This mode start operates the way is shown on figure 23. 
After reset, MS checks for active Backup/Recovery mode request (Backup/Recovery operational key is ON). 
If request is active 7–segment display shows symbol for Recovery mode   and engagement start. 
Engagement function is used to engage recovery mechanism to the worm via recovery nut – figure 1, item 7.

Completion of engagement is indicated by Recovery engaged indication lamp (figure 3, point 10). 
If lamp is off after first engagement, reset is needed. Reset will activate engagement again.

Controlling of Recovery is with 3–position key Backup/Recovery Down/Up located on front door of control cabinet – figure 3 item 5. 
Also Recovery can be controller remotely if that is provided by electrical circuit diagram.

After engagement is complete and Recovery engagement lamp is on, brake of main hoist motor should be released. 
Otherwise motor brake will prohibit movements. Brake should remain open until recovery operation done.

For disengagement, load should be on safe place, main hoist motor brake should be closed. 
Command for lowering should be given to MS until both lamps for Upward enable and Downward enable becomes on.

.. warning::
    Recovery function is mainly designed for safety lowering of the load. 
    Function allows very short lifting of the load only in case if it is absolutely necessary!

.. warning::
    Before activating Backup/Recovery operation mode from local controls (figure 3, item 4), 
    please make sure that operation mode is not activated remotely.

- Recovery mode lamp and Recovery engaged lamp are off,
- Backup/Recovery control key is in position “0” (OFF),
- On 7–segment display symbols |image058| or |image041| are not displayed.
