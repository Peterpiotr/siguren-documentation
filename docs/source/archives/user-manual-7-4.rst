Glossary
========

General 
--------

|image3|

**Wheel or wheel with skewed teeth**

The wheel that is fitted to the hoisting shaft.

**Screw, Worm Screw or endless screw**

A shaft shaped with a screw at one side and spline of the other side.
With the wheel, the screw is one of the main components of the
MotoSuiveur®.

**Screwing or screwing rotation**

Clockwise rotation of the screw viewed from spline part of the screw
shaft (right handside on the drawing). On an irreversible MotoSuiveur®
such as the hydraulic version, the screwing rotation corresponds to the
hoisting up rotation of the hoisting shaft and the wheel.

**Unscrewing or unscrewing rotation**

Anticlockwise rotation of the screw viewed from spline part of the screw
shaft (right handside on the drawing). On an irreversible MotoSuiveur®
such as the hydraulic version , the unscrewing rotation corresponds to
the hoisting down rotation of the hoisting shaft and the wheel.

**Screwing/Unscrewing and up/down**

Screwing and unscrewing are physically linked to the the worm screw of
the Motosuiveur. Since friction Motosuiveurs are reversible, in some
installations screwing can be up while down on others. On installations
that have two Motosuiveurs, they can be mounted in opposite direction.

**Inward translation**

Translation of the screw as if the screw was rotating and translating in
the screwing direction (clockwise).

When the wheel is stopped, the translation can occur with the screwing
rotation of the screw.

During a hoisting down operation or a fall, when the wheel rotates
faster than the screw, the latter translates in the screwing direction
towards the screwing hard stop

**Outward translation**

Translation of the screw as if the screw was rotating and translating in
the unscrewing direction.

When the wheel is stopped, the translation can occur with the unscrewing
rotation of the screw.

During a hoisting up operation when the wheel rotates faster than the
screw, the latter translates in the unscrewing direction towards the
outward hard stop

**Inward hard stop**

The hard stop that limits the inward translation. The inward hard stop
position is detected by a sensor.

**Outward hard stop**

The hard stop that limits the outward translation. The outward hard stop
position is detected by a sensor.

Friction Motosuiveur®
---------------------

**Reversibility**

The friction Motosuiveur® is mechanically reversible, which means that
is can indifferently be mounted in one orientation or the other and can
absorb a fall according both mountings.

When delivered with its control cabinet, the Motosuiveur® must either be
mounted according to the logics of the cabinet which cannot know how the
Motosuiveur® is oriented.

**Friction absorber**

The friction absorber is a device fitted inside the wheel used to absorb
and dissipate the energy of a sudden fall before the screw does its
blocking job.

The friction absorber is constituted of friction disks stacked
alternatively with inner disks and outer disks. Those disks are
positioned inside the wheel. Stator disks are mechanically connected to
the wheel while the inner disks are connected to the hoisting shaft.

The disks are pressed together by a series of spring washers (Belleville
washers). The pressure is set by putting a number of washers that meets
the installation requirements.

Hydraulic Motosuiveur®
----------------------

**Irreversibility**

The Hydraulic Motosuiveur® is irreversible, which means that it can
absorb the energy of a fall only in one direction.

**Reaction arm**

The hydraulic absorbs the energy on a very short course. When the energy
must be absorbed on a longer course of the load, in order to have a
smother deceleration, the Motosuiveur® can be mounted in a floating mode
and be held by a reaction arm. Fitted with an absorber, this arm absorbs
the energy by letting the Motosuiveur® rotate from 0° to 330° according
to the requirements.

Motosuiveur® with recovery option
---------------------------------

**Recovery clutch or clutch**

The gear that is used to engage the recovery motor. The mechanism is
quite similar to a Bendix motor starter.

**Clutch pinion wheel or pinion wheel in a clutch context**

The part of the recovery clutch that is driven by the recovery motor and
that has only one degree of freedom : rotation.

The pinion wheel is bored with a spline in its central axis to receive
the flywheel.

**Clutch flywheel or flywheel**

The wheel that translates on the screw shaft guided by spline.

The external part of the flywheel is fitted with a hollow cylinder that
has a position cam at is end.

The flywheel is pushed by a spring that is protected by the flywheel
cylinder an is fitted on a screw thread etched in the flywheel. It can
be tuned by turning it more or less in the thread.

The spline of the flywheel posses a hook that is used to maintain the
flywheel inside the pinion wheel during the recovery hoisting up
operation.

When the clutch pinion wheel and the flywheel are meshed, the recovery
motor can drive the screw.

**Recovery engagement**

Procedure that consists of engaging the flywheel into the pinion wheel
to mesh their splines in order to allow the recovery motor to drive the
screw.

It is composed of two phases:

-  the pre-engagement that pushes the screw in its inward hard stop.

-  The engagement that engages the flywheel into the pinion wheel.

This operation is usually performed automatically by the control cabinet
logics. It can be done when needed by other means.

The engagement is detected by a sensor.

Motosuiveur® Control Cabinet, Motosuiveur® control box
------------------------------------------------------

**Motosuiveur® control panel, control cabinet, control box or electrical
cabinet**

The electrical cabinet that contains relays, logical unit, motor
drivers, relays, circuit breakers and wiring.

**Proface, touch screen, programmable logic controller**

The Proface is the programmable logic controller that is the interface
between the buttons and beacons that are on the control panel, the
driver of servo-motor(s) of the screw, the driver of the recovery motor
if any and the hoisting installation electrical cabinet.

**Drive, controller**

The motor controller that drives the Servo-motor. When control cabinet
manages many Motosuiveurs, each servo-motor is driven by its own drive.

**Recovery Motor Drive**

The recovery motor controller that drives the recovery motor. When
control cabinet manages many Motosuiveurs, each recovery motor is driven
by its own drive.

Operating modes
---------------

**Normal mode**

The standard operating mode when no major fault occurs.

**Recovery mode**

Capability given to the Motosuiveur® when equiped with a recovery motor
to perform hoisting up and down operations at low speed. It is used when
the main hoisting chain is faulty.

**Backup mode**

Feature that allows the load to be lowered down, by using minimal
capabilities. The Motosuiveur® limits the free fall to programed level.
It is used as an extreme solution.

Presentation of the Motosuiveur® system
=======================================

Application of the Motosuiveur® system
--------------------------------------

The Motosuiveur® is designed to protect winches against risks of control
loss on the handled load, and this in every case of electrical or
mechanical failure.

It also allows emergency operation of the hoist using the recovery
facility, in case of electrical or mechanical failure.

Moreover, it offers the possibility to check the parameters, to test the
securities of the program by modifying some parameters.

General description of a passive friction Motosuiveur® equipped winch
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A classic winch equipped with a Motosuiveur® is typically made up of the
following main parts:

Mechanical part
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Electrical part
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functioning principle of a Friction Motosuiveur®
------------------------------------------------

The wheel is connected to the drum through a splined shaft or a torque
transmission flange (connected with dowels). The worm screw is rotated
by a small motor (servo-motor), controlled by the duplicate of the
command signals delivered to the motor brake of the winch. Thus, the
worm screw accompanies the movement of the wheel / drum set (assembly).
In this configuration, the worm screw does not oppose to the movement of
the wheel / drum set. At shutdown, the load is maintained by the service
brake.

Any accident will generate a rupture in the accompaniment of the
movement of the wheel / drum set, which results in a blocking of the
last one (and thus the blocking of the load) by the worm screw. In such
a case, the Motosuiveur®\ :sup:`®` stops the load in a distance
depending on the hoist inertias and torque, by friction of the internal
disks of the friction absorber inside the MS wheel\ [STRIKEOUT:.]

As option, a torque limiter can be added between the main motor and the
gear box in order to smooth the static and dynamic overloads.

The Motosuiveur® interprets and executes the same commands as the main
system, but independently of this one. Due to the irreversibility of the
wheel/worm screw couple, it limits the immediate speed of the winch to a
speed slightly superior to the theoretical speed. This principle of
«mechanical follow-up» is the "intrinsic" part of safety that the
Motosuiveur® provides.

The system also works in accordance with the principle of the comparison
between the planned speed and the real speed. The real speed and the
position, resulting from a direct measure, are constantly compared with
the value of the order ( slope included) coming from the control panel.
Then they are analysed by the computer. When the limits are reached, the
Motosuiveur® activates the safety procedure.

Functioning principle of a Hydraulic Motosuiveur®
-------------------------------------------------

A hydraulic Motosuiveur® absorbs fall energy inside a hydraulic chamber.
Its capacity to absorb energy is limited to the fall direction, this is
why it is not reversible.

Friction absorber
-----------------

The friction absorber is a compact energy absorber fitted inside the
wheel. It is composed of disks alternatively linked to the wheel and to
the shaft that are pressed together at the desire pressure through a
number of spring washers defined at the factory to meet the defined
blocking torque. The friction absorber equips mainly the Friction
Motosuiveur® but it is not theoretically limited to it and could be
installed on a Hydraulic Motosuiveur®.

Recovery principle (option)
---------------------------

The recovery is performed by engaging a clutch on the screw in order to
let a motor more powerful than the servo-motor drive the screw.

The recovery motor power is calculated to allow the hoisting up and down
of the maximum load plus the brakes resistance, supposing the latter
cannot be released for whatever reasons, at a speed that is 1/10 to
1/100 of the minimum hoisting speed. Since power is directly
proportional to torque and rotation speed, the recovery motor can be up
to a hundred times smaller than the hoisting motor. This leads to a very
compact solution.

Main characteristics
--------------------

Mechanical characteristics of the installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image5|

The nameplate of the Motosuiveur® indicates the maximum rotating speed,
the corresponding braking torque and other characteristics (mass, oil
quantity, etc…)

   |image6|\ *The Motosuiveur® is factory set taking into account the
   speed, load and inertia of the equipment. Increasing the speed /
   inertia of the equipment on which the Motosuiveur® is installed is
   not allowed and may lead to serious damage.*

Reception, handling, storage
============================

Important comment:
------------------

The Motosuiveur® is designed to resist the dynamic solicitations of a
defined application; so before any putting in operation, make sure that
the installation complies entirely with the application that the
Motosuiveur® have been ordered by checking the nameplate.

Appearance of a new Motosuiveur®, reception
-------------------------------------------

On delivery check that all the following parts are present or already
mounted and operational:

-  The Motosuiveur®

-  The breather cap

-  The electric cabinet

-  The supply cables

-  The torque limiter (OPTION)

On delivery check that they didn’t get damaged during transportation. In
particular, check the absence of bumps, knocks or scratches which may
have occurred.

For any noticed problem, write down all reserves on delivery on the
carrier delivery sheet, then confirm by registered mail to the carrier
within 48 hours.

* *

|image7|

   *The Motosuiveur® of the installation can be attached to a torque
   limiter (as option) rated to a value specifically calculated for your
   application. Similarly, the electric boxed sets containing
   equipment’s which are pre-set to the specific values of your
   application must not be inverted.*

Handling
--------

All Motosuiveur® are checked after assembly, set and tested on bench.
During those tests, the oil filling up is adjusted and the hydraulic
system is drained. To prevent draining again the system on activation,
the Motosuiveur® must be handled in the position shown in the
illustration below, with the cap in top position.

Before any handling, check:

-  The correct balancing of the load,

-  The handling equipment capacity and compare it to the load to lift.

-  That the slings and straps do not lean on fragile parts (pipes,
   diverse accessories, etc.) and that they do not damage the surface
   treatment applied on our products.

|image8|

   Never lift a Motosuiveur® hanged by the motor.

Storage
-------

The operations to display to ensure good preservation conditions depend
mainly on the storage duration and on its thermal, hygrometric and
climatic environmental conditions.

In case of ship transportation, the packaging must be waterproof and
wear a humidity absorbing product.

The equipments must be stored in a dry place, away from bad weather
conditions and important temperature variations.

Put the equipments on an insulating paper covered wooden base.

Short period storage (inferior to 3 months)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the tests and the final checks, the manufactured parts of the
Motosuiveur® must be protected by peelable varnish and the oil fill up
must be adjusted to the level indicator. In this condition, they can be
stored in vertical position, without any intervention during 3 months.
Beware not to damage the peelable varnish protection.

Medium period storage (inferior to 1 year)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a storage period of 3 to 12 months, our Motosuiveur® must be
completely filled with the oil designed for your application
functioning.

This oil will be drained off to the level indicator before use. There
will be no need to rinse it. During the emptying beware not to go under
the level indicator; otherwise, you will have to drain the system.

Long period storage (inferior to 5 years)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a storage period longer than 12 months, to 5 years, drain the
Motosuiveur® then pour or spray ARDROX IV 2 (supplier Brent) in the
machine (5 % of the total volume).

*Properties:*

The volatile corrosion inhibitor is designed to:

-  Protect by its gas phase the surfaces that are not in contact with
   the liquid phase,

-  Reinforce by its liquid phase the inhibitory action of the liquid in
   which it is dissolved.

Before use, the production product being soluble and miscible in
lubrication oils, it will not be necessary to clean.

For a medium or a long period of storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The corrosion inhibitors being volatile, during all the storage period
make sure the inside of the Motosuiveur® is insulated for the exterior.
In particular, the breather caps must be replaced by hermetic caps. The
trap doors must be hermetically closed.

Every 3 months:

-  Rotate the PV wheel (at least 1 turn) manually.

-  Check the protection by peelable varnish of the manufactured parts.

Protection of the manufactured parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The manufactured surfaces are delivered protected by a peelable varnish
(standard case).

Excepting deterioration, there is no need for another protection.

**Used product: ARDROX 3140.**

Installation
============

Safety instructions
-------------------

The Motosuiveur® is designed to resist the dynamic solicitations of a
defined application; so before any putting in operation, make sure that
the installation complies entirely with the application which the
Motosuiveur® has been ordered for (**appendix 5**). In particular, check
if the N° given on the specification nameplate is the same as the one on
the plan (**appendix 5**)

Before any operation on the equipment, switch off the electrical supply
and ensure that the load cannot move.

Never place your hands inside the Motosuiveur®, without being sure that
the rotation of the shafts is impossible.

Never rotate the Motosuiveur® if the trap door is open or/and if the
protection cover of the torque limiter is removed (OPTION)

Do not modify the machine. Any modification of the kinematic chain
increasing the inertias, the limiter adjustments (OPTION) or the maximum
speeds can be dangerous.

All work must be carried out by competent staff with an appropriate
training.

Read carefully the special safety instructions on **appendix 1**.

In this document, all comments preceded by: |image9| are related to
safety.

Environment
-----------

A Motosuiveur® is a safety organ, thus it needs regular surveillance
interventions and operating in urgency situations. So it has to be
*easily accessible*.

In particular, the following conditions are required:

-  Allow handling.

-  Ensure accessibility.

-  Ensure the safety of the maintenance and surveillance staff.

-  Insulate the equipment of a too polluting environment.

-  Allow a normal air admission necessary to a good thermal exchange.

-  Ensure acceptable room temperature (from 0° C to 45° C) for the
   standard version).

-  A sheltered working location.

-  Ensure that using the handle is easy and can be done in sufficient
   safety conditions.

-  The electric boxed set containing the operating console must be easy
   to reach. It is better if it is next to the Motosuiveur® and visible
   by an operator located near the handle. If it is not feasible,
   install a buzzer near the Motosuiveur® to gravity lowering operations
   with the service brake.

-  Make sure that the electric cables between the Motosuiveur® and the
   electric boxed set are not subject to chemical or mechanical
   aggressions.

-  Make sure that no heat source is in direct contact with the
   Motosuiveur®.

-  The Motosuiveur® must be filled with oil **SIGUREN SQ32**

Steps
-----

For a fine installation of the Motosuiveur® and to avoid ill-timed
blockings during the setting of the command station and of the drives,
we advise you to start the winch assembly by following these steps:

-  [STRIKEOUT:Mounting of the torque limiter (OPTION)]

-  Setting and testing of the lifting drive and the command cabinet

-  Installation of the Motosuiveur® on the drum and its reaction arm

-  Positionning of the manual commands

-  Oil level check

-  Electric linking of the Motosuiveur®

Assembly of the torque limiter (OPTION)
---------------------------------------

See **appendix 3** for technical sheet.

Assembly must be done by qualified operators.

The torque limiter is delivered factory rated to the value necessary to
the application. In case of doubt, check the application data on the
assembly drawing.

The limiter assembly direction is defined on the layout.

The torque limiter coupling is made of:

-  The permanent spring limiter

-  The duplex coupling chain

-  The driving hub

|image10|

Figure 6-1: Torque limiter

The cylinder of the limiter part contains helical springs which create
the pressure force applied to the friction linings.

|image11|

Figure 6-2: Torque limiter

The response curve of the helical springs allows to keep, without much
fluctuation, the pressure force applied to the linings. Thus, no matter
their degree of wear, the fluctuation of the pre-set torque is
insignificant.

It is the number of springs which defines the rating torque;

   |image12|\ *The limiter being delivered rated for the application;
   the limiter part should never be dismantled. Never add nor withdraw a
   spring during normal functioning of the winch. Any maintenance
   operation should be done by SIGUREN or an authorized representative.*

Setting and tests on the drives
-------------------------------

It is preferable that before the Motosuiveur® is assembled, settings and
tests are performed on the hoist drives:

-  the acceleration ramps

-  the deceleration ramps

-  the opening of the service brake against the motor torque

-  the closing of the service brake against the motor speed

-  the thresholds of the fixed speeds

-  the minimum and maximum speeds

The Motosuiveur® is programmed to brake as soon as the maximum and
minimum thresholds are exceeded for each of these values.

If when engaged the drive is not correctly set, the Motosuiveur® will
automatically brake, until the good value is obtained.

Setting-up on the drum
----------------------

To avoid having to do a new drain of system before putting it in
service, the Motosuiveur® must be transported in the authorized
positions shown above in figure 4.

   |image13|\ *Before setting it up, check the way the Motosuiveur® is
   positioned the right way according to the supplied mounting drawing.*

Manual command handle (OPTION -not supplied)
--------------------------------------------

The manual operation devices allow the Motosuiveur® to set-down the load
in case of a breakdown (gravity lowering). The operating procedure is
described in chapter 5.

|image14|

|image15|

For example, the manual command handle can be composed of a standard
speed handle (square ¾ “), a socket universal and a socket

Figure 7: Manual command handle

|image16|

   It must be used by operators informed of procedures

It is to be used only in case of gravity lowering with manual control
from the Motosuiveur®, for example in case of power failure of the
electric supply of the Motosuiveur®

To use it, one has to remove the protection cover of the worm screw of
the Motosuiveur® and its fixation screws, and then set up the handle.

After use, put the cover back with the fixation screws.

Lubrication
-----------

The Motosuiveur® are checked after assembly, set and tested on bench at
Siguren. During those tests, the oil tank is filled.

|image17|\ |image18|

Figure 8: Breather cap with dipstick

After the reaction arm set-up:

-  Clean if necessary the upper side of the Motosuiveur®.

-  Unscrew it and check the oil level.

-  Screw the breather cap completely.

..

   |image19|\ *During this operation, make you do not introduce any
   particle in the Motosuiveur®*

   *Use only the* **SIGUREN SQ32** *oil. Using other oil can induce
   important malfunctions.*

Electrical connection of the Motosuiveur® 
------------------------------------------

The electrical box of the Motosuiveur® is delivered with cables already
in place with the motor and encoder cables and their connectors.

See electrical diagram provided in **appendix 4**.

Architecture of the control system
==================================

Introduction
------------

The Motosuiveur® control system comes with different architectures to
meet the installation requirements.

The Motosuiveur has been designed to be integrated almost stand-alone on
hoisting system and basically requires only the servo-motor controller
to be connected to the main hoist panel. However, most of the time, the
Motosuiveur is integrated in the control system with its own control
system.

All configurations integrate the very same servo-motor controller
software.

Description of the main components
----------------------------------

Servo-motor controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Motosuiveur is fitted with a servo-motor that adapts the rotation
of the worm screw to the orders given to the hoist motor. The
servo-motor is controlled by a controller that embeds a software
especially developed by the Motosuiveur manufacturer.

The servo-motor controller is connected directly to the servo-motor
through a dedicated cable that controls the servo-motor and sends
position data back to the controller.

Architecture of a standalone Motosuiveur
----------------------------------------

|image20|

In the standalone architecture, the Motosuiveur servo-motor controller
receives only inputs from the Main hoist control panel, basically Up and
Down and potentially analog and digital inputs from the Motosuiveur
sensors.

Worm screw positions coming from digital sensors are sent to the Main
hoist control panel.

Classical integration of the Motosuiveur in the control system
--------------------------------------------------------------

|image21|

Human Machine Interface (HMI)
=============================

Touch screen
------------

The system uses a touchscreen attached to the logics controller (Proface
from Digital Electronics Corp).

The display has two functions:

-  Display data and main information.

-  Configure the Motosuiveur® system. Configuration is always protected
   with PIN according to the required level of authorization and
   requires a qualified operator.

Before using settings must be configured:

-  Quick stop delay time

-  MS directions for back up mode

These settings are saved in case of power cut.

The display screen possesses its own parameter settings that can be
accessed in offline mode. This mode is accesses by touching the upper
right corner of the screen just followed by a touch on the lower left
corner.

Time setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter offline mode, and touch the [Date and Time] button.

|image22|

The display unit clock can be updated periodically or at a specified
timing. By using this feature, time adjustment in offline mode is
unnecessary.

Touch screen battery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The touch screen’s battery’s lifetime has a 10-years guaranty certified
by the manufacturer.

When the installation is out of power, the battery allows the touch
screen to keep in memory the date, time, the events record and the
functioning time for approximately 3 months. Afterwards the data may be
lost.

The full charge time of a totally discharged battery is 96 hours.

Screen colors convention
------------------------

Note: Not all screens follow the following rules but they will be
modified in future versions to meet those rules.

can have a great impact on the Motosuiveur® operations.

When CAN is not OK, further access to values is not possible.

Those variables are 32bits integers named “long” in the MS drive and 32
bits float numbers named “real” in the MS drive. They are referred in
the settings as “VL” for “longs” and “VR” for “reals”.

|image36|

*Example: changing VL3 of the MS1 parameters*

-  Select the group of parameters you want modify.

-  Select the parameter you want to modify (for example VL3)

-  Read the current value. Write the new value in green and validate.

-  Push the”Back” button to access others parameters.

-  At the end you must return to the MS parameters page and push the
   return button to save the modifications in the drive.

Table mode for changing MS parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the CAN network is working properly it is possible to display and
access all the parameters from a table. This feature has been introduced
in version 1.2 of the control software to bring a better usability. It
will coexist with the previous parameter setting mode until the latter
is removed in future version of the software if the table mode proves
its convenience.

The access to the parameter table mode is done by clicking on the top
right button.

|image37|

When the CAN network is not available a message is displayed to mention
the impossibility to access the values on the remote MS drive and modify
them.

|image38|

The values are presented in table with from left to right : the name of
the parameter, its description, the current value of the parameter and
to captured value.

|image39|

Right hand side arrows allow the navigation on 64 variables from
variable 0 to variable 63.

The field in red displays the current value set in the selected MS
drive.

The field in green that is set to 0 when no change has been made allows
the capture of a new value.

It is possible to to switch from long variables to real variables by
selecting the “VR” button and go back to long variables by selecting the
“VL” button.

If changes have been made to a set of variables make sure to save them
before pressing a variable type selection button otherwise a message is
displayed to remind that some values have been modified.

|image40|

| A click on“No” brings the previous screen back in order to check the
  values and save them.
| A click on “Yes” cancels all the changes and displays the table with
  the other set of values.

The same protection is offered when leaving the parameter settings
screen by clicking on the “Back” button. By clicking on “Yes”, the
previous screen

|image41|

Save and cancel buttons

The “Save” button saves all the changes inside the input fields and
resets all the input fields to 0.

Only the values that have been changed in the input fields are saved.

The values are then transferred to the remote MS drive.

Caution : writing a value from 0 to X in the input fields and writing
back 0 in this field is considered as a change.

The “Cancel” button cancels all the inputs inside the input fields.

**Important**:

When changing the MS servo-motor drive (controller) those data are to be
set again.

All the values are set at the factory but are accessible with priority 3
for customer convenience. Modifying those values necessitates an
especial competence. *They should not be modified without the advices
from the manufacturer*.

Quick stop delay 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Quick stop delay” is the delay needed to reach speed = 0 after an
E-stop (immediate request for hoist motor stop without ramp).

|image42|

The “Quick stop delay” is adjustable between 0 to 9 s.

The purpose of the “Quick stop delay” is to protect the mechanical line.
An inappropriate too short delay can lead to MS fault.

If the delay is too long, the hoist availability is poor.

These settings are saved in case of power shortage.

These settings must be configured after HMI software reboot.

Safe Work period
----------------

This feature is under development and will provide data for the hoisting
system Safe Work Period as well as all the information for the
Motosuiveur® maintenance whether they are based on the number of
rotation of the worm or on their lifetime.

|image43|

User settings, buzzer and/or flashlight settings (OPTION)
---------------------------------------------------------

The buzzer and/or the lights (option) switch on in the following cases:

-  Fault detection as logged in the “Events record”

-  Over-speed during lowering in back-up mode.

-  Activation of the (anti-pianotage) or (anti-inversion) (options).

When the installation is fitted with an alarm buzzer, it can be
acknowledged either by a button or by a timer or both.

The buzzer starts with the flashlight.

The flashlight starts and stays on until the fault has been solved.

Buzzer settings is available from the menu at “Other settings”.

A timer can be set for an automatic stop of the buzzer after the delay
set for the timer.

If the timer is set to 0, the buzzer is n until it is acknowledge by a
button.

The setting of the timer delay is available through the menu at
“\ *Other settings*\ ” under the “\ *Buzzer switch off delay*\ ” field.

**Access to the “Other settings” screen requires permission password
level 2**.

To modify the switch off delay, click the “Buzzer switch off delay”
field and enter the value with the proposed soft keyboard. The value is
limited to 999s.

|image44|\ A 0 value indicates that the buzzer and the flashlight can
only be switched off by the acknowledge button.

The “Acknowledge buzzer” button stops the buzzer and the flashlight.

In addition alarm lights output and buzzer output are provided on the
Motosuiveur® control cabinet.

The acknowledge button stops the timer until the next fault and has the
same effect as the physical “acknowledge alarm” button on the control
panel.

Factory settings
----------------

MS settings allows the definition of the number of Motosuiveurs in an
installation as well as the type (rotation direction that correspond to
the mountings of those Motosuiveurs, see screwing/unscrewing and up/down
in the glossary).

The type definition is important for the backup mode and the recovery
mode.

**MS settings require manufacturer permission level.**

Defining the number of Motosuiveurs in an installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of Motosuiveurs can be either 1 or 2.

|image45|

The type is specified in the electrical cabinet wiring specification.

Defining the number of nodes on the CAN network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The access to the setting of available nodes on the CAN network is done
by clicking the « Next » button on the MS settings screen.

On an installation with one Motosuiveur®, the drive of the servo-motor
is set to be on node 2.

When there is a second Motosuiveur®, its drive is set to be on node 3.

Some installations have a CAN input/output extension for connecting
additional binary inputs.

This extension in that case this extension is set to be on node 5.

|image46|

The selection of the presence of those nodes is set by clicking the
corresponding check-boxes.

Selection of the sensor types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 2 position sensors that check whether the worm screw is
centered or not.

They are either mechanical or magnetic.

The standard rule is to have sensors that are on when everything is
correct and off otherwise (worm not centered or wiring issue). Those
sensors are PNP identified as PNP either for magnetic sensors controlled
with electronics or mechanical sensors.

The other case « NPN » is rare.

When a recovery motor is installed the sensor that detects the
engagement of the clutch is of the same type.

|image47|

Hydraulic Motosuiveurs have an oil low level detection that also detects
the oil temperature. The latter is only sent to the Servo-Motor drive
for adapting torque to oil viscosity.

Setting the reduction coefficient between the hoisting shaft and the worm rotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reduction coefficient will be used in future Safe Work Period
feature to measure the number of revolutions of the shaft through the
number of revolutions of the servo-motor. It is accessed by clicking
“Next” on the sensor types screen.

|image48|

Recovery settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recovery motors are used on installations that cannot afford to stop
hoisting operations either by the main installation chain failure or by
the Motosuiveur® servo-motor failure.

Recovery settings define the automatic Recovery motor clutch engagement
policy.

**Access to recovery settings requires manufacturer permission level.**

|image49|\ Installations that have only one Motosuiveur® can only have 0
or 1 recovery motor.

Installations that have 2 Motosuiveurs can only have 0 or 2 recovery
motors.

The automatic engagement is performed by putting the worm in its unscrew
mechanical stop position. The clutch flywheel is pushed against the
clutch pinion wheel by a spring and both wheels teeth have to
interconnect. Slight screwing and unscrewing movements at low torque are
applied to the recovery motor until the sensor detects that the flywheel
is engaged

Selecting the operating modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The selection of the operating modes is the equivalent of the use of the
Normal mode/Recovery mode/backup mode selection hard button on the main
control panel.

The access to that screen requires permission level 3 password. This
operation is to be handled by expert operators exclusively.

The principle of the Motosuiveur® makes it possible to have the 3
operating modes selected either independently or in a combination of
those modes. If on control panels, the selection can be done with a 3
position selection button or with 3 switches, the control by software
offers all the possible combinations.

This screen is normally accessed when hard control buttons are not
accessible or the main panel is not operating for whichever reasons.

The display shows the selection made from the main panel with red
lights.

The position of the soft buttons indicate the selection that is really
applied to the system. This means that the last action is the actual
action.

At the opening of the screen the lights that symbolize the position of
the selection buttons on the remote main panel and the switches are
synchronized.

|image50|

When the operator makes selects a soft switch position on the screen
that is different from the main panel selection, his/her action
overrides the selection button on the main panel.

The switches and the lights remain asynchronized until their positions
are updated on the main panel or on the screen.

If the selection of the selection button on the main panel changes the
switches change accordingly giving the user a correct view of the
selection on the main panel

|image51|

Back-up mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Settings**

Prior to using Backup mode, the Motosuiveur® types, that correspond to
rotation directions, must be configured.

**Using Back up mode**

In this mode, it is possible to lower the load “by gravity” through the
main kinematic chain, with a speed managed by the Motosuiveur®, without
accurate knowledge of the speed.

The lowering by gravity could be done by different ways depending on the
available items in the kinematic chain (main motor, Motosuiveur® motor,
etc.). The procedures n° 2.1 to 2.4 describes the different
possibilities for the back-up.

**Back Up mode commands**

**MS1 commands \| MS2 commands**

**Synchro**

|image52|\ |image53|

Backup mode allows the rotation control of the Motosuiveur®(s)
servo-motor(s).

Release function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is automatically activated just after a fault reset.

Selecting the recovery mode from the touch screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image54|

When the recovery mode is selected, either from the main control panel
selector (left hand-side picture) or locally (from the touch screen) the
recovery selection lets an arrow button appear.

On installations with 2 Motosuiveurs and 2 recovery motors, when the
hoisting shaft is divided into two parts, connected together with a
gear, it may be possible that an action on the recovery motors may not
hoist up or down synchronously on both recovery motors which could lead
to the lost of horizontality of the beam. The maximum difference between
both length can be set in units measured by the Motosuiveur®. This
maximum difference is set in factory but can also be adapted during the
operation to solve unplanned issues.

Recovery motor engagement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The arrow button gives the access to the engagement procedure screen.

|image55|

For completing the engagement process, the controllers of the recovery
motors must be operational and the clutch engagement sensors must be off
to detect the engagement.

When the recovery motor controllers are not operational, the engagement
status light is blinking and turns on to red.

|image56|

On installations with 2 recovery motors the engagement procedure is done
one after the other. The completion of a phase is symbolized by the red
horizontal bar that turns green when ok.

The engagement process is launched by clicking on the yellow button.

|image57|

During the engagement procedure the engagement status light blinks and
turns yellow.

On installations with 2 Motosuiveurs and 2 recovery motors the
engagement of the first Motosuiveur® is symbolized by half of the
horizontal bar turning green.

|image58|

When the recovery motors are totally engaged the bar turns totally
green, the status button turns to steady green, and it is possible to
access recovery operations by clicking “To recovery operation”.

|image59|

If the engagement is not completed before the timeout, the engagement
status light turns to steady red.

|image60|\ It is possible to proceed with many engagement request until
the engagement completes. Too many trials should lead to the conclusion
of a deeper issue.

Operating recovery from the touch screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operating the recovery from the touch screen is quite similar to
operating it from the Motosuiveur® control panel.

|image61|

Up and down operations are performed by clicking up or down buttons.

On installations with 2 recovery motors they can be operated
synchronously (middle up/down buttons) or independently (left and right
hand side up/down buttons).

On the synch mode, the system keeps a potential difference inside the
limit.

|image62|\ When a mechanical problem occurs, the operator may need more
flexibility. In that case he/she may use the async up/down buttons and
control himself/herself the difference and potentially exceeds the
limits.

|image63|

Important remarks
-----------------

The Motosuiveur® is a security device which does guaranty that the load
will not be dropped by the hoist.

In case of a malfunction of the system, **appendix 2** helps the
operator to find the possible cause of the malfunction and to choose the
appropriate procedures to repair it.

It is important to consult the other security instructions (**appendix
1**) before using the Motosuiveur®.

Running modes and functions
---------------------------

Without fault, the « normal » mode is selected automatically when the
system is powered on.

The operator can select the different modes (option) and functions, on
condition that the operator has the suitable right.

For safety reasons, the access to certain functions needs a password.
The three password levels and user rights are the following:

+----------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+

+----------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+

The procedure n°1 describes the way to follow to enter a password and
the user rights.

The different modes and functions accessible are the following:

Normal mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

The crane runs normally through the standard joystick, as long as the
speeds and accelerations are respected.

In this mode, the Motosuiveur® checks in real time the movement
direction, the accelerations and the speeds (including during load stop
and even when there is no speed reference given to the system).

In case of fault, the Motosuiveur® ensures security by stopping the
movement. A fault message is displayed. It is then possible to know the
fault number and to reset it from the hoist reset button.

In case of the fault can’t be reset, it is possible to finish the
movement by switching to “backup” modes (option) (**procedure n° 2.1 to
2.4** according to the related case).

Using of the recovery system (OPTION)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*This chapter describes the recovery procedures for installations fitted
with recovery motors.*

The purpose of the recovery system is to lower the load on a safe place
if a component of the overall lifting equipment is damaged or
unavailable.

   |image64|\ *The system has to be used only by trained and authorized
   workers.*

   *The procedures must be correctly followed to avoid damaging the
   equipment.*

The following table shows the procedure to follow in each case of
failure:

+----------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+

If the reason of the failure is not diagnosed proceed in the following
order:

-  Procedure n°6-1

-  Then Procedure n°6-2

-  Then Procedure n°6-3

-  Then Procedure n°6-4

Procedure n°6-1: Recovery after load drop. Operation from the hardware buttons. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This procedure has to be followed after a load drop. The Motosuiveur®
carries the load.

**STEP 1 : selecting “recovery mode”**

-  On the Main control panel, select “Recovery mode” on the “Normal
   mode” to “Recovery mode” selection button.

-  *When selecting “Recovery mode”, the Proface touch screen turns
   automatically to the “Engagement screen” (see Recovery procedure with
   the Proface for more details).*

**STEP 2 : Engaging the clutch(es) of the recovery motor(s)**

The engagement procedure is done automatically by the Siguren control
panel logics.

-  *If the “ Clutch engaged” light is already on, jump to next step.*

-  Otherwise, on the Siguren control panel, press and release the
   “Engagement” push button.

-  *On the Proface touch screen, the blinking orange light indicates
   that the Motosuiveur® is proceeding with the engagement.*

-  *On installations with 2 recovery motors, the engagement procedure is
   performed one after the other. Any modification on these settings
   requires level 4 password.*

-  *The duration of the engagement cycle is set in the “recovery
   settings” menu by the manufacturer. It is typically set between 1 to
   3 minutes per recovery motor.*

-  *The clutch(es) of the recovery motor(s) is/are engaged when* the
   “Recovery available” light of the Siguren control panel switches on.

-  On the Proface, the engagement light turns to permanent green. A
   button appears on the right handside bottom to allow the
   visualization of the recovery operation screen.

**STEP 4: The engagement process fails**

-  There are a few reasons why the engagement procedure could fail:

-  At least one controller of the recovery motor(s) is not working,

-  Recovery motors power is not turned on,

-  The engagement procedure is stopped by time out

**Issue with recovery motors**

Make sure the recovery controllers are running properly.

Make sure the recovery motors are powered on.

**Engagement process time-out:**

-  If the engagement is not completed before the cycle timeout, the
   “engagement” light on the control panel does not turn on, the
   engagement status light turns to permanent red.

-  The engagement failure may come from a short setting of the
   engagement cycle timeout delay. If the engagement procedure fails due
   to timeout, it is possible to repeat the procedure again from STEP 2.

-  After many failed trials, verify that the recovery motor(s)
   operate(s) correctly.

-  See “potential reasons for an engagement failure” paragraph next
   page.

**STEP 5 : Recovery hoisting down operations**

-  It is possible to perform recovery operations if and only if the
   recovery motor(s) is/are engaged.

-  On the Siguren control panel, turn the selection button to “Recovery
   down” to lower the load on the floor (or on a safe area).

..

   |image65|\ *It is possible to hoist the load up if necessary. But
   avoid hoisting the maximum load up with the recovery facility during
   more than 1 minute.*

   *Also make sure that the service brake is open during this movement.
   If it is not the case, it is mandatory to lower the load. If this
   condition is not respected, the equipment could be damaged.*

-  When the load touches the floor, release the “recovery down”
   selection button of the Siguren control panel.

-  Remove the load from the hook.

-  On the Siguren control panel, select “Recovery up”. This action
   disengages the clutch(es). “Recovery available” light should turn
   off.

-  In the recovery control box, press the push button “Recovery up” to
   disengage the nut. Check that the “Nut engaged” lamp switches off and
   the “Nut disengaged” lamp switches on.

*Note: At the end of this procedure the Motosuiveur® screw is locked in
the elastomers in the lift side. With the main hoisting motor, make a 1
second movement at low speed in the down direction to unlock the screw.*

It’s important to cut the power supply of the equipment before any
maintenance operation.

Do not power up the equipment until the failed component has been fixed
or changed.

   |image66|\ *The recovery feature is designed to be used as an
   exceptional hoisting solution.*

   *Lengthy and/or repetitive use of the recovery facility can cause
   excessive wear of the Motosuiveur®.*

Procedure n°6-2: Operating the recovery operations from the Proface touchscreen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The recovery operations can be done either from the Siguren control
panel with physical buttons or from the Proface touchscreen.

Operating from the Proface can be the prefered choice when the Siguren
control panel is not easily accessible and that the Proface touchscreen
is installed on the remote control box.

**STEP 1 : selecting “recovery mode”**

The recovery mode can be either selected from the Main hoisting cabinet
by selecting “Recovery Mode” on the selection button or from the Proface
touch screen.

-  You need to know the password for level 3 authorization to proceed
   with recovery operations.

-  On the touchscreen, from the main screen, select “Menu” at the right
   hand-side bottom of the Main operation screen.

-  Select “Operating modes” in this menu.

-  A keypad screen appears to propose you to enter “the level 3”
   password.

-  Enter the correct PIN and press enter to get access to the “Operating
   modes” screen.

-  Select the mode by clicking the Recovery switch button.

-  On installations with 2 recovery motors make sure that the “Max
   position difference” number is correct. This value is expressed into
   the servo-motor position coding units. It is normally preset by the
   manufacturer. However, it may vary according installations (diameter
   of the drum(s) etc.). Once modified this parameter is saved.

-  Proceed with engagement by pressing the arrow button.

-  On installations with 2 recovery motors, the position difference
   between both Motosuiveurs is automatically reset to compute the
   difference from this value.

-  The screen switches to the engagement procedure screen.

-  Press the “Recovery engagement” yellow button to start the engagement
   cycle.

-  On installations with 2 recovery motors, engagement processes
   recovery motors engagement one after the other. The red bar turns
   half green half red when the first recovery motor is engaged and
   totally green when both are engaged.

-  *On the Proface touch screen, the blinking orange light indicates
   that the Motosuiveur® is proceeding with the engagement.*

*Engagement procedure request the Motosuiveur servo-motor to put the
screen into the unscrew mechanical stop and at the same time the
recovery motor does little screw and unscrew movements at low torque to
let the clutch flywheel mesh with the clutch wheel.*

-  *The duration of the engagement cycle is set in the “recovery”
   settings menu by the manufacturer. It is typically set between 1 to 3
   minutes per recovery motor.*

-  *On installations with 2 recovery motors, the engagement is done one
   after the other. The second recovery motor starts is engagement
   process when the first one is engaged.*

-  *The clutch(es) of the recovery motor(s) is/are engaged when* the
   “Engagement status” light turns to permanent green. In parallel the “
   Recovery available” light of the Siguren control panel switches on.
   *A button appears on the right handside bottom to allow the
   visualization of the recovery operation screen.*

**STEP 4: The engagement procedure fails**

There are a few reasons why the engagement procedure could fail:

-  At least one controller of the recovery motor(s) is not working,

-  Recovery motors power is not turned on,

-  The engagement procedure is stopped by time out

**Issue with recovery motors**

Make sure the recovery controllers are running properly.

Make sure the recovery motors are powered on.

**Engagement process time-out:**

-  If the engagement is not completed before the cycle timeout, the
   “engagement” light on the control panel does not turn on, the
   engagement status light turns to permanent red.

-  The engagement failure may come from a short setting of the
   engagement cycle timeout delay. If the engagement procedure fails due
   to timeout, it is possible to repeat the procedure again from STEP 2.

-  After many failed trials, verify that the recovery motor(s)
   operate(s) correctly.

-  See “potential reasons for an engagement failure” paragraph next
   page.

| **Potential reasons for a recovery engagement failure**               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Recovery clutch engagement may fail if:                               |
|                                                                       |
| -  the engagement sensor is not working properly (blocked in upper    |
|    position). The engagement could be effective while the indication  |
|    is wrong.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| -  when the worm does not pre-engage due to a potential               |
|    servo-motor/servo-motor drive issue (this failure may be indicated |
|    by the position sensor still on but not always.                    |
|                                                                       |
| -  The recovery motor or its drive are faulty.                        |
|                                                                       |
| -  A mechanical problem occurred on the recovery clutch.              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

**STEP 5 : Recovery hoisting up/down operations**

The engagement performed from the Proface touch screen can be followed
by hoisting up/ hoisting down operation performed from the Siguren
control panel. We describe here operation made from the Proface touch
screen.

-  It is possible to perform recovery operations if and only if the
   recovery motor(s) is/are engaged.

-  One the recovery is available, the access to the hoisting operation
   screen is done by pressing the “To hoisting operation” rightward
   arrow on the right hand-side bottom.

-  The screen displays the status of the engagement switch (ISN), the
   status of the VAR that controls the recovery motors.

|image67|\ |image68|

-  |image69|\ Up and down hoisting operations are down with up and down
   buttons...

-  All load hoisting up operations under recovery should not exceed 1mn
   and wait for the recovery motor to cool down during 10 mn.

-  Some installations, in particular those with two Motosuiveurs, have
   an oversized recovery capablity. In that case hoisting up operations
   may have no time limit. Verify your installation capabilities

-  On installations with 2 recovery motors, it is possible to run
   recovery motors independently or in sync(center buttons). The default
   operation mode is moving both recovery in sync. Operating them
   separatly should be restricted to especial scenarios. The logics
   verifies that the position of each Motosuiveur® and compares them.
   The position difference cannot exceed the maximum defined in the
   “Recovery settings” or in the “Operating mode” screen when selected
   on “Recovery” (figure 24) and it is protected by the logics. A
   physical position difference exists if and only if the hoisting shaft
   is broken, e.g. if it is composed of two parts connected by a gear
   and that gear is broken.

|image70|

-  If the position difference exceeds the limit, the logics blocks the
   movement of each recovery motor in the direction that would increase
   the difference whether the order is done independently or in sync.

-  |image71|\ This limitation persists until the position difference is
   back to 0 (figures 39 and 40).

|image72|

|image73|

-  | When the load touches the floor, the hook stops lowering for about
     30s.
   | Continue pressing the “Recovery down” button until the hook start
     to lower again, the free the hook.

-  Remove the load from the hook.

-  In the recovery control box, press the push button “Recovery up” to
   disengage the nut. Check that the “Recovery engaged” light switches
   off and the “Recovery disengaged” light switches on.

*Note: At the end of this procedure the Motosuiveur® worm is locked in
the elastomers in the lift side. With the main motor, make a 1 second
movement at low speed in the down direction to unlock the screw.*

It’s important to cut the power supply of the equipment before any
maintenance operation.

Do not power up the equipment until the failed component has been fixed
or changed.

   |image74|\ *Lengthy and/or repetitive use of the recovery facility
   can cause excessive wear of the Motosuiveur®.*

Procedure n°6-3: Recovery with pre-engagement with the load
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This procedure has to be followed in the case which the hoist is loaded
or/and the Motosuiveur® is failed. The service brake has to be operable.

|image75|

   *It is required that the load is enough distant to the floor to
   accept a load slip equal to the maximum braking distance of the
   Motosuiveur®.
   To refer to the Motosuiveur® calculation note to have the maximum
   braking distance.*

1. Switch off the supply of the Motosuiveur® cabinet or all the circuit
   breaker inside.

2. In the recovery control box, switch from “Normal mode” to “Recovery
   mode”.

3. In the recovery control box, press the “Brake opening” until the load
   stops.

|image76|

   *Be careful, at this step the load will slip from a height equal to
   the braking distance of the Motosuiveur®.*

4. In the recovery control box, press the “Nut engagement” push button
   until the “Nut engaged” lamp switches on.

5. In the recovery control box, press the push button “Recovery down” to
   lower the load on the floor (or on a safe area).

|image77|

   *It’s possible to raise the load if necessary. But avoid raising the
   maximum load with the recovery facility during more than 1 minute.*

   *Also take care that the service brake is open during this movement.
   If it is not the case, it is mandatory to lower the load. If this
   condition is not respected, the equipment should be damaged.*

6. | When the load hits the floor, the hook stops lowering for about
     30s.
   | Continue pressing the “Recovery down” button until the hook start
     to lower again, the free the hook.

7. Remove the load from the hook.

8. In the recovery control box, press the push button “Recovery up” to
   disengage the nut. Check that the “Nut engaged” lamp switches off and
   the “Nut disengaged” lamp switches on.

*Note: At the end of this procedure the Motosuiveur® screw is locked in
the elastomers in the lift side. With the main motor, make a 1 second
movement at low speed in the down direction to unlock the screw.*

It’s important to cut the power supply of the equipment before any
maintenance operation.

Do not power up the equipment until the failed component has been fixed
or changed.

|image78|

   *Lengthy and/or repetitive use of the recovery facility can cause
   excessive wear of the Motosuiveur®.*

Procedure n°6-4: Recovery with pre-engagement with the hoist motor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This procedure has to be followed in the case which the hoist is not
loaded and the Motosuiveur® is failed.

1. Switch off the supply of the Motosuiveur® cabinet or all the circuit
   breaker inside.

2. Make a lowering movement with the main motor drive until the load
   stops.

..

   *Because the Motosuiveur® cabinet is shut down, the Motosuiveur®
   authorization is off. It is possible that this information has to be
   override by the main controls. Anyway, the drum has to be rotated in
   order to push the screw in the damping chamber (lowering side).*

   *Be careful to stop the command while the hook stops in order to not
   wear and/or overheat the torque limiter.*

3. In the recovery control box, switch from “Normal mode” to “Recovery
   mode”.\ |image79|

4. In the recovery control box, press the “Nut engagement” push button
   until the “Nut engaged” lamp switches on.

5. In the recovery control box, press the push button “Recovery down” to
   lower the load on the floor (or on a safe area).

|image80|

   *It’s possible to raise the load if necessary. But avoid raising the
   maximum load with the recovery facility during more than 1 minute.*

   *Also take care that the service brake is open during this movement.
   If it is not the case, it is mandatory to lower the load. If this
   condition is not respected, the equipment should be damaged.*

6. | When the load hits the floor, the hook stops lowering for about
     30s.
   | Continue pressing the “Recovery down” button until the hook start
     to lower again, the free the hook.

7. Remove the load from the hook.

8. In the recovery control box, press the push button “Recovery up” to
   disengage the nut. Check that the “Nut engaged” lamp switches off and
   the “Nut disengaged” lamp switches on.

*Note: At the end of this procedure the Motosuiveur® screw is locked in
the elastomers in the lift side. With the main motor, make a 1 second
movement at low speed in the down direction to unlock the screw.*

Do switch power supply of the equipment off before any maintenance
operation.

Do not power the equipment on until the failed component has been fixed
or changed.

Maintenance 
============

Basic Preventive Maintenance 
-----------------------------

The Motosuiveur®® reliability can apply if and only if the maintenance
protocol is strictly followed.

Maintenance operation is to be done based either on the number of
revolutions given by the servo-motor drive display or on a time basis
wherever the smallest value applies.

(See following page for maintenance sheet).

Spare parts ordering
--------------------

For any spare part order, please give the serial number of the
Motosuiveur®.

The Motosuiveur ® spare parts list is presented in the table in
**Appendix 6**.

 Advise for the safety inspections
----------------------------------

For any inspection by a control organization, we advise to inform them
that the installation is equipped with a Motosuiveur® and a torque
limiter, and to give them this user manual.

| For the dynamic tests at 1.1 times the rated load, the preset value of
  the torque limiter is normally calibrated to a value sufficient to
  allow movement
| For static tests, two cases may occur depending on the preset value of
  the torque limiter:

-  *If the torque limiter is calibrated to a value greater than the
   static load:*

In this case the static load can be handled by the main motor at low
speed, avoiding the jerks and high acceleration.

-  *If the torque limiter is calibrated to a value lower than the static
   load:*

In this case, either you change the setting of the torque limiter by
adding springs, or you use additional loads. In the last case, it is
necessary to:

-  Lift the load by the main motor.

-  Open service brake to release the load on the Motosuiveur®.

-  Add to the rated load, additional load by some other means of
   lifting.

-  Perform the measurements.

-  Remove the additionnal loads.

-  Perform the release of the Motosuiveur®

-  Remove the nominal load.

In the case you change the setting of the torque limiter, you must:

-  Power off the installation.

-  Remove the nut of the torque limiter

-  Add the number of springs provided (See technical sheet of the torque
   limiter in **appendix 3**)

-  Put the nut and screw tight

-  Power on the installation and manipulate the test load at **low
   speed.**

-  After testings, power off the installation and do the same by
   removing the added springs.

|image88|\ *Forgetting added springs can cause damage in the
Motosuiveur® (risk of abnormal over-torque in case of emergency brake)*

Various back-up mode allowable depending on the situations (OPTION)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In case of incident or accident, the MS stops the load. It should then
set up a procedure to restore the handling. It is the purpose of the
back-up mode which are described in **procedures 2.1 to 2.4**

These situations can be very diverse, but can be distinguished depending
on the availability of electrical means, and the following solutions are
summarized in the table below:

+---------------+-------------+-------------+-----------+------------+

This function is used when an incident occurs and the Motosuiveur® stops
the load. The back-up could be done whatever the case, safely, by acting
simultaneously on the two kinematic chains, by available means.

The **procedures n° 2.1 to 2.4** helps the operator on the actions to be
done\ **.**

Remark: If the MS is operational, it allows the movement of the main
motor only at low speed

Procedure n° 2.1: Back-up by manual action of the service brake (OPTION)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure has to be followed in case of main motor fault. The
following procedure allows the operator to switch in back-up up mode
with manual opening of the service brake.

   **Comments**:

-  This procedure requires two operators (one for the manual service
   brake opening, the second one at the MS-1 cabinet).

-  Ensure power to the motor is removed.

-  Each of the two operators can stop the operation: the first operator
   by closing the service brake, the other operator by stopping the
   rotation of MS.

|image91|

1. On the main screen, press « Menu »

2. Then press « Back up mode »

3. Enter a level 2 (or 3) password

4. On the activation screen of the back-up mode, press “activate back up
   mode”

5. Operator n°1 : Allow the motion by pushing the button up or down on
   the touch screen

..

   Operator n°2 : Simultaneously with operator n°1, release the service
   brake little by little in order to allow the lowering of the load by
   gravity without reaching overspeed, otherwise the Motosuiveur® will
   block.

When the limit speed is reached, the MS goes into action intrinsically
by blocking the worm.

Given the relatively slow speed, it is easy to stop the action on the
brake before the end of the travel of the Motosuiveur®. The operation
can then continue without any special intervention, since the screw goes
back to its position automatically.

In case of hard blocking, it should be possible to release the
Motosuiveur® by using the handle

*NOTA:* *to switch back to “normal mode”, it is necessary to power-off
then power-on the electrical cabinet.*

Procedure n°2.2: Back-up by manual action of the service brake and manual rotation of the Motosuiveur® (OPTION)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure has to be followed in case of one Motosuiveur® motor is
defective.

The lowering movement is controlled manually by the operator, through
the handle at the

Motosuiveur® shaft.

This procedure is practically identical to that described above. The
only difference occurs in step 5 where the operator 1 should place the
crank of MS on the screw and follow manually (unlike the previous case
where tracking was performed using the control box).

**Comments:**

We have to take care to switch off the Motosuiveur® cabinet.

Each of the two operators can stop the operation: the first operator by
closing the service brake, the second operator by stopping the rotation
of MS.

During this procedure, the lowering is controlled by the operator on the
service brake. The other operator follows the movement and can always
stop it.

1. Switch off the Motosuiveur® cabinet (The Motosuiveurs should be
   driven manually)

2. Dismantle the worm cover of the MS

..

   |image92|

3. Mount the manual handle on the MS

..

   |image93|

4. Repeat steps 1 to 4 of the previous procedure (procedure 2.1)

5. The operator n°1 opens the service brake step by step (to allow the
   lowering of the load by gravity without exceeding a certain speed, in
   which case the MS blocks). Meanwhile, the other operator n°2 should
   follow the movement by rotating the handle

Procedure n° 2.3: Back-up by forced lowering (OPTION)
-----------------------------------------------------

This procedure has to be done in case of the main kinematic chain is not
available (gearbox or transmission shaft breakage).

**Comment:**

-  To carry out this procedure, you must provide a mechanism to drive
   the MS worm. This mechanism should produce a high enough torque to
   move the load (taking into account the weight of the load and the
   various specific frictions due to this type of recovery). For
   example, we can use a motor and a reducer adapted.

-  Only one operator is needed for this procedure.

|image94|

**This procedure has to be done as a last resort. The other back-up
procedures have to be prioritised because, in the forced lowering, the
worm and the wheel are worn quickly.**

1. Switch off the Motosuiveur® cabinet

2. Remove the worm cover

3. Set up the drive mechanism on the MS worm and start process at lower
   speed.

4. As soon as the load is safe (on the ground or an adapted structure),
   inspect the Motosuiveur® (worm and wheel) and the crane

Procedure n° 2.4 : Electrical/ automatic back-up (OPTION)
---------------------------------------------------------

This procedure is to be done when the two kinematic chains are
operational but other types of faults appear (disadjusments etc.). It
allows moving the load at a certain position at slow speed.

**Comment**:

-  Only one operator is needed for this procedure

9.  Repeat steps 1 to 5 of the procedure 2.1

10. Move at low speed (up or down) by operating on the control box.

*When the limit speed is reached, the MS goes into action intrinsically
by blocking the worm.*

Procedure n° 2.5 : Automatic Recovery engagement
------------------------------------------------

*(To be completed)*

Hoist interfaces
================

|image95|

*Inputs for MS cabinet*

-  ON : hoist drive ready

-  UP : command for UP movement

-  DOWN : command for DOWN movement

-  RESET: must be used after a MS drive fault (not for MS sensors)

*Outputs for MS cabinet*

-  MS ready UP : Up movement is available

-  MS ready DOWN: Down movement is available

-  Quick stop :

   -  After a MS fault (drive or sensor), immediate stop of hoist drive,
      without ramp.

   -  After quick stop delay time, adjustable on HMI, with a sensor
      fault, it's possible to start in the opposite direction. With a MS
      drive fault, it's necessary to push RESET button after hoist state
      control.
