Presentation of the Motosuiveur® system
=======================================

Application of the Motosuiveur® system
--------------------------------------

|image5|

|image6|

The Motosuiveurs® are designed to protect winches against risks of
control loss on the handled load, and this in every case of electrical
or mechanical failure.

They also allow:

-  gravity lowering of the load by activation of the service brake,

-  manual use of the winch down and possibly up, with the hydraulic
   system.

Moreover, they offer the possibility to check the parameters, to test
the securities of the program by modifying some parameters.

General description of a Motosuiveur® equipped winch
----------------------------------------------------

A classic winch equipped with an Motosuiveur® is typically made up of
the following main parts:

Mechanical part
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image8|

Electrical part
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image9|\ |image10|\ |image11|\ |image12|\ |image13|\ |image14|\ |image15|

Functionning Principle
----------------------

The wheel is connected to the drum through an intermediate pinion. The
worm screw is rotated by a small motor, controlled by the duplicate of
the command signals delivered to the motor brake of the winch. Thus, the
worm screw accompanies the movement of the wheel / drum set (assembly).
In this configuration, the worm screw does not oppose to the movement of
the wheel / drum set. At shutdown, the load is maintained by the service
brake.

Any accident will generate a rupture in the accompaniment of the
movement of the wheel / drum set, which results in a blocking of the
last one (and thus the blocking of the load) by the worm screw. In such
a case, the Motosuiveur\ :sup:`®` stops the load almost immediately,
with damping effect and without overspeed (hydraulic chamber).

The MS Torque Limiter, which is situated between the main motor and the
gear box smooth the static and dynamic overloads.

The Motosuiveur® interprets and executes the same commands as the main
system, but independently of this one. Due to its irreversibility, it
limits the immediate speed of the winch to a speed slightly superior to
the theoretical speed. This principle of " mechanical follow-up " is the
"intrinsic" part of safety that the Motosuiveur® provides.

The system also works in accordance with the principle of the comparison
between the planned speed and the real speed. The real speed and the
position, resulting from a direct measure, are constantly compared with
the value of the order ( slope included) coming from the control panel.
Then they are analyzed by the computer. When the limits are reached, the
Motosuiveur® activates the safety procedure.

Reception, handling, storage
============================

Important comment :
-------------------

The dimensions of the Motosuiveur® are evaluated by our design office to
resist the dynamic solicitations of a defined application; so before any
putting in operation, be sure that the installation complies entirely
with the application that the Motosuiveur® have been ordered.

Appearance of a new Motosuiveur®, reception
-------------------------------------------

On delivery ensure that all the following parts are present:

-  The Motosuiveur®

-  The breather cap

-  The electric cabinet

-  The supply cables

-  The MS Torque Limiter

-  The manual command handle

On delivery be sure that they didn’t get damaged during transportation.
In particular, check the absence of bumps, knocks or scratches which may
have occurred.

For any noticed problem, write down all reserves on delivery on the
carrier delivery sheet, then confirm by registered mail to the carrier
within 48 hours.

* *

|image20|

   *Both Motosuiveurs® of the installation are attached to one torque
   limiter rated to a value specifically calculated for your
   application. Similarly, the electric boxed sets containing equipments
   which are preset to the specific values of your application must not
   be inverted.*

Handling
--------

All our Motosuiveur®, are controlled after assembly, set and tested on
bench. During those tests, the oil filling up is adjusted and the
hydraulic system is drained. To prevent draining again the system on
activation, the Motosuiveur® must be carried in vertical position, with
the worm cover in top position.

Lifting rings have been placed on all our equipments for when these
equipments require the use of lifting means.

Before any handling, check:

-  The correct balancing of the load,

-  Your handling equipment capacity and compare it to the load to lift.

-  That the slings and straps do not lean on fragile parts (pipes,
   diverse accessories, etc.) and that they do not damage the surface
   treatment applied on our products.

|image21|

   Never lift a Motosuiveur® hanged by the motor.

Storage
-------

The operations to display to ensure good preservation conditions depend
mainly on the storage duration and on its thermal, hygrometric and
climatic environmental conditions.

In case of ship transportation, the packaging must be waterproof and
wear a humidity absorbing product.

The equipments must be stored in a dry place, away from bad weather
conditions and important temperature variations.

Put the equipments on an insulating paper covered wooden base.

Short period storage (inferior to 3 months)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the tests and the final checks, the manufactured parts of the
Motosuiveur® must be protected by peelable varnish and the oil fill up
must be ajusted to the level indicator. In this condition, they can be
stored in vertical position, without any intervention during 3 months.
Beware not to damage the peelable varnish protection.

Medium period storage (inferior to 1 year)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a storage period of 3 to 12 months, our Motosuiveur® must be
completely filled with the oil designed for your application
functioning.

This oil will be drained off to the level indicator before use. There
will be no need to rinse it. During the emptying beware not to go under
the level indicator; otherwise, you will have to drain the system.

Long period storage (inferior to 5 years)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a storage period longer than 12 months, to 5 years, drain the
Motosuiveur® then pour or spray ARDROX IV 2 (supplier Brent) in the
machine (5 % of the total volume).

*properties:*

The volatile corrosion inhibitor is designed to:

-  Protect by its gas phase the surfaces that are not in contact with
   the liquid phase,

-  Reinforce by its liquid phase the inhibitory action of the liquid in
   which it is dissolved.

Before use, the production product being soluble and miscible in
lubrification oils, it will not be necessary to clean.

For a medium or a long period of storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The corrosion inhibitors being volatile, during all the storage period
make sure the inside of the Motosuiveur® is insulated for the exterior.
In particular, the breather caps must be replaced by hermetic caps. The
trap doors must be hermetically closed.

Every 3 months :

-  Rotate the PV wheel (at least 1 turn) manually.

-  Check the protection by peelable varnish of the manufactured parts.

Protection of the manufactured parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The manufactured surfaces are delivered protected by a peelable varnish
(standard case).

Except if there is some deterioration, there is no need for another
protection.

**Used product : ARDROX 3140.**

Installation 
=============

Safety instructions
-------------------

The dimensions of the Motosuiveur® are evaluated by our design office to
resist the dynamic solicitations of a defined application; so before any
putting in operation, it has to be checked that the installation
complies entirely with the application which the Motosuiveur® has been
ordered for. In particular, check if the N° given on the specification
plate is the same as the one on the plan.

Before any operation on the equipment, switch off the electrical supply
and ensure that the load can not move.

Never place your hands inside the Motosuiveur®, without being sure that
the rotation of the shafts is impossible.

Never rotate the Motosuiveur® if the trap door is open or/and if the
protection cover of the MS Torque Limiter is removed.

Do not modify the machine. Any modification of the kinematic chain
increasing the inertias, the limiter adjustments or the maximum speeds
can be dangerous.

All work must be carried out by competent staff with an appropriate
training.

Read carefully the special safety instructions on **appendix 1**.

In this document, all comments preceded by : |image22| are about safety.

Environment
-----------

A Motosuiveur® is a safety organ, thus it needs regular surveillance
interventions and operating in urgency situations. So it has to be
*easily accessible*.

In particular, the following conditions are required:

-  Allow handling.

-  Ensure accessibility.

-  Ensure the safety of the maintenance and surveillance staff.

-  Insulate the equipment of a too polluting environment.

-  Allow a normal air admission necessary to a good thermal exchange.

-  Ensure acceptable room temperature (from 0° C to 45° C) for the
   standard version).

-  A sheltered working location.

-  Ensure that using the handle is easy and can be done in sufficient
   safety conditions.

-  The electric boxed set containing the operating console must be easy
   to reach. It is better if it is next to the Motosuiveur® and visible
   by an operator located near the handle. If it is not feasible,
   install a buzzer near the Motosuiveur® to gravity lowering operations
   with the service brake.

-  Make sure that the electric cables between the Motosuiveur® and the
   electric boxed set are not subject to chemical or mechanical
   aggressions.

-  Make sure that no heat source is in direct contact with the
   Motosuiveur®.

-  The Motosuiveur® must contain hydraulic oil.

Steps
-----

For a fine installation of the Motosuiveur® and to avoid ill-timed
blockings during the setting of the command station and of the drives,
we advise you to start the winch assembly by following these steps:

-  Assembly of the MS Torque Limiter

-  Setting and testing of the lifting drive and the command cabinet

-  Installation of the Motosuiveur® on the drum

-  Installation of the reaction arm

-  Positionning of the manual commands

-  Oil level check

-  Electric linking of the Motosuiveur®

|image23|

   *The Motosuiveur® should never be engaged without its MS Torque Limiter.
   This would cancel all garantee.*

Assembly of the MS Torque Limiter
------------------------------

The installation is equipped with a **RS 160.1** MS Torque Limiter (Siam
Ringspann).

*See appendix 4 for technical sheet*

Assembly must be done by qualified operators.

The MS Torque Limiter is delivered factory rated to the value necessary to
the application. In case of doubt, check the application data on the
assembly drawing.

The limiter assembly direction is defined on the layout.

The MS Torque Limiter coupling is made of:

-  The permanent spring limiter

-  The duplex coupling chain

-  The driving hub

|image24|

|image25|\ The cylinder of the limiter part contains helical springs
which create the pressure force applied to the friction linings.

The response curve of the helical springs allows to keep, without much
fluctuation, the pressure force applied to the linings. Thus, no matter
their degree of wear, the fluctuation of the preset torque is
insignificant.

It is the number of springs which defines the rating torque; the slotted
nut must always be screwed very tightly against the cylinder.

The lubrication of the MS Torque Limiter chain is not necessary, except in
case of corrosion risk (aggressive environment).

   |image26|\ *The lubrication of the chain should be done with a
   standard grease for bearings, not by oil. Use a very small quantity
   (in order to cover only the chain). Take care not to grease the
   friction lining. Greasing the friction parts of the MS Torque Limiter
   will misadjust the MS Torque Limiter.*

   |image27|\ *The limiter being delivered rated for the application,
   the limiter part should never be dismantled. Never add nor withdraw a
   spring during normal functioning of the winch. You would be taking an
   important risk of damaging the equipment and all guarantee would be
   lost. Any maintenance operation should be done by SIGUREN technologies or an
   authorized representative.*

Setting and tests on the drives
-------------------------------

It is preferable that before the Motosuiveur® is assembled, settings and
tests are performed on the drives:

-  the acceleration ramps

-  the deceleration ramps

-  the opening of the service brake against the motor torque

-  the closing of the service brake against the motor speed

-  the thresholds of the fixed speeds

-  the minimum and maximum speeds

The Motosuiveur® is programmed to brake as soon as the maximum and
minimum thresholds are exceeded for each of these values.

If when engaged the drive is not correctly set, the Motosuiveur® will
automatically brake, until the good value is obtained.

**Advise :**

To facilitate the gravity lowering operations for the load brake, we
advise to replace the unblocking handle of the standard service brake
(delivered with the motor) with a long lever. This allows to better
control the opening of the service brake during the gravity lowering.

Setting-up on the drum
----------------------

To avoid having to do a new drain of system before putting it in
service, the Motosuiveur® must be transported in vertical position (worm
cover in top direction).

   |image28|\ *Before setting it up, check the way the Motosuiveur® is
   positioned the right way. A wrongly positioned Motosuiveur® cancels
   all guarantee.*

   *The right way is indicated by an arrow on the side of the
   Motosuiveur® as shown below;*

**
The arrow indicates the direction of spin of the Motosuiveur® during the
lowering of the load.**

|image29|

On the manual command side of the Motosuiveur® another arrow on the belt
cover indicates the direction of spin of the worm screw during the
lowering.

|image30|

Manual operation
----------------

The manual operation devices allow the Motosuiveur® to set-down the load
in case of a breakdown (gravity lowering). The §‎5 “Functionning after an
incident or a accident” describes the related procedures.

   |image31|\ *These devices may be used in emergency situations. They
   must be placed in appropriate ways on a visible support next to the
   Motosuiveur®.*

   *They must be used by staff well aware of the emergency procedures*

Manual command handle 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image32|

It is to be used only in case of gravity lowering with manual control
from the Motosuiveur®, for example in case of power failure of the
electric supply of the Motosuiveur®

To use it, one has to remove the protection cover of the worm screw of
the Motosuiveur® and its fixation screws, then set up the handle.

After use, put the cover back with the fixation screws.

Hydraulic torque wrench
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image33|

Use this device only in case of gravity lowering by forced action of the
Motosuiveur®.

To use it, see **procedure 6**.

|image34|

   *After a gravity lowering by forced action of the Motosuiveur®, a
   disassembly and an inspection of your Motosuiveur® is essential to
   safety. This operation should be done by SIGUREN technologies.*

Lubrication
-----------

All our Motosuiveur®, are checked after assembly, set and tested on
bench at Siguren. During those tests, the oil tank is filled, the level
is adjusted and the hydraulic system is drained (oil quantity =
15 litres).

The breather cap is delivered separately and replaced by a waterproof
cap.

|image35|\ |image36|

After the reaction arm set-up:

-  Clean if necessary the upper side of the Motosuiveur®.

-  Remove the pulley casing cover.

-  Screw the breather cap completely.

-  Unscrew it and check the oil level.

-  Reassemble the pulley casing cover and its screws

..

   |image37|\ *During this operation, make you do not introduce any
   particle in the Motosuiveur®*

   *Use only the* **TOTAL ELAN EPX 75W80** *oil. Using another oil can
   induce important malfunctions.*

Drain of the hydraulic system
-----------------------------

After each switch on of the Motosuiveur® an auto diagnostic is run to
check the absence of air in the damping chamber. If air is detected, the
damping chamber has to be drained.

This operation must be carried out by a qualified operator. It is
similar to the operation of draining a car braking system. The
Motosuiveur® should be oriented in the following direction :

|image38|

Procedure :

-  Power off the machine.

-  Make sure the oil level is sufficient.

-  Remove the protection cover of the worm screw of the Motosuiveur® and
   its 3 fixation screws.

-  Set-up the manual command handle.

-  Rotate the worm screw by turning slowly the handle in the lifting
   direction until the stop.

-  Rotate the screw to the opposite direction by turning slowly the
   handle in lowering direction until the stop.

-  Repeat the operation 5 times.

..

   |image39|

   *A loose drain screw can result in an insufficient braking and damage
   the Motosuiveur®.*

-  Disassemble the command handle.

-  Re-assemble the protection cover of the worm screw of the
   Motosuiveur® and its 3 fixation screws.

-  Power on the Motosuiveur® (an automatic autodiagnostic is launched)

 Electrical linking of the Motosuiveur® 
----------------------------------------

The electrical box of the Motosuiveur® is delivered with cables already
in place with the motor and encoder cables and their connector.

Motosuiveur® use

Motosuiveur® parameters and Motosuiveur® back-up menus are protected by
a password (see **procedure n°1**).

Choice of the language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|image47| |image48|

The language choice menu allows the operator to choose English, French
and Dutch language, from “Setup” button of the main menu.

Important remarks
-----------------

The Motosuiveur® is a safety device which guarantees that the load will
not be dropped by the winch.

-  The Motosuiveur® can function correctly only if its setting matches
   the real state of the equipment. In order to prevent the equipment
   from being damaged and operators from being seriously injured, the
   accuracy and the appropriateness of the settings of the Motosuiveur®
   must be guaranteed before putting it in operation.

-  In case the system becomes faulty, **appendix 2** will help the
   operator to find out the possible source of the problem and will
   guide him through the procedures to apply.

It is important to read the other safety instructions (**appendix 1**)
before any use of the Motosuiveur.

Fault recording
---------------

The system records all faults. These can be seen through the interface
by clicking on “Events record”. The following parameters are recorded :

-  Date

-  Hour

-  Motosuiveur® number

-  Fault number

|image49|\ |image50|\ |image51|

Battery life
------------

The battery life is 10 years.

Without power, the battery of the display unit is able to keep hour and
date for three months. If the display unit is not powered for three
months, the date and the hour are lost.

The recharge time for an empty battery is 96 hours.

Putting in operation
--------------------

When it is powered on, the system begins automatic test cycles, ensuring
the software validity (software test), the correct initial state of the
commands (electric test) and the mechanical capabilities of the
Motosuiveur® (mechanical tests).

These tests form the system autodiagnostic procedure (see §‎4.6
“Autodiagnostic tests”)

After the test sequence ended, the system becomes operational and
automatically switches to « normal » mode. So, it is possible to move
the load by joystick.

*NOTA :  to prevent ill-timed movements, the joystick has to be released
when the test sequence is finished. In the opposite case, a fault is
displayed (n°4). Once the operator releases the joystick, the movement
is possible again and the fault disappears.*

Autodiagnostic tests
--------------------

The autodiagnostic test guarantees the proper functioning of the
Motosuiveur® and that the mechanical safety inferred by the
irreversibility of the worm screw is operational.

|image52|\ This test is launched when the Motosuiveur® cabinet is
powered on and after an automatic release. The autodiagnostic lasts
approximately 2 minutes : during this time, no movement is available
(the line contactor is open)

   **The autodiagnostic test needs to be done regularly (at least every
   week). If the installation is powered permanently, the operator needs
   to launch an autodiagnostic by powered off the installation.**

The autodiagnostic is composed by 2 kinds of control :

Electric test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image53|

This test consists in checking that the circuits controlled or driven by
the MotoSuiveur® are in a correct initial state (commands in neutral
position, contactor, etc.). The objective of this test is to prevent
ill-timed motion on start.

Mechanical test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This group of tests (flow, air and play) corresponds to mechanical
checking of the system.

-  **Flow test**

|image54|

The system controls automatically if the oil flow which passes through
the nozzles is correct.

-  **Air presence test**

|image55|

This test detects the presence of air bubbles in the damping chamber.

-  **Play test**

|image56|

The system automatically measures the play between the teeth of the worm
gear and the teeth of the worm screw and the play between the screw and
the damping chamber. This measure allows us to detect all the wear
problems for the gears and the possible presence of unknown elements.

The different advantages of this autodiagnostic are that it is automatic
and intrinsic to the Motosuiveur® (no external measure instrument is
employed) on one hand, reliable (High precision encoder) and fast (about
2 minutes) on the other hand.

In case the autodiagnostic tests are negative, there are several
possible actions for the operator :

-  If the operator identifies and resolves the problem (forgotten
   handle, screw slightly blocked…), he can run another diagnostic.

-  And if there are no other possible solutions left, and qualified
   operator can switch to gravity lowering mode to secure the load and
   eventually repair the Motosuiveur.

*NOTA : during autodiagnostic operation, the flashing lamp is activated.
As soon as the crane is available (after a positive result of the
autodiagnostic), the flashing light is off.
*

Autodiagnostic results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For both Motosuiveurs, the results of the last autodiagnostic are
recorded. “Play test”, “Damping test” and “Air presence test” can be
displayed for each Motosuiveur. These figures are the results of Siguren
internal calibration, they are not physical values. They vary from one
Motosuiveur to another.

|image57|\ |image58|

|image59|\ |image60|\ |image61|\ |image62|

Autodiagnostic fault
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the autodiagnostic fails, the operator can re-launch a new
autodiagnostic by clicking on “Re-launch self-test” or switch to
“back-up” mode (see §‎4.10.2 ”\ **Release function**

This function is automatically activated just after a fault reset. The
procedure n°2 allows the operator to reset a fault.

An autodiagnostic test is automatically done after a successful
automatic release.

If the automatic release procedure is not successful, the operator needs
to release the system manually (“manual release “ procedure n°3).

**Back-up mode**\ ”).

The software and firmware versions can be displayed, for Motosuiveur
n°1, Motosuiveur n°2 and the display.

|image65|

Password and user rights
------------------------

For safety reasons, the access to certain functions needs a password.
There three password levels and user rights are the following :

+---------------+------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Password      | L    | Allows :                                      |

+---------------+------+-----------------------------------------------+

*See procedure n°1 for password entry*

Running modes and functions
---------------------------

Without fault, the « normal » mode is selected when the system is
powered on.

The operator can select the different modes and functions, on condition
that the operator has the suitable right.

The **procedure n°1** describes the way to follow to enter a password
and the user rights.

The different modes and functions accessible are the following :

Normal mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

The crane runs normally through the standard joystick, as long as the
speeds and accelerations are respected.

In this mode, the Motosuiveur® checks in real time the movement
direction, the accelerations and the speeds (including during load stop
and even when there is no speed reference given to the system).

In case of fault, the Motosuiveur® ensures security by stopping the
movement. A fault message is displayed. It is then possible to know the
fault number and to reset it (see **procedure n°2**).

In case of the fault can’t be reset, it is possible to finish the
movement by switching to “back-up” modes.

Release function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is automatically activated just after a fault reset. The
procedure n°2 allows the operator to reset a fault.

An autodiagnostic test is automatically done after a successful
automatic release.

If the automatic release procedure is not successful, the operator needs
to release the system manually (“manual release “ procedure n°3).

Back-up mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this mode, it is possible :

-  to lower the load “by gravity” through the main kinematic chain, but
   with a defined speed controlled by the Motosuiveur, without accurate
   knowledge of the speed.

-  Run all the movements but at a limited speed (0,13 m/min).

The lowering by gravity could be done by different ways depending on the
available items in the kinematic chain (main motor, Motosuiveur® motor,
etc.). The **procedures n° 4 to 7**
(pages `52 <#procedure-n-4-back-up-by-manual-action-of-the-service-brake>`__
to `57 <#procedure-n-7-electrical-automatic-back-up>`__) describe the
different possibilities for the back-up.

Modification of parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function (**procedure n°9**) allows the operator to modify the
following data :

-  Speeds S1, S2, S3 and S4 for each Motosuiveur® (S1=lowest speed)

-  Overspeeds for S1, S2, S3 and S4 for each Motosuiveur

-  Acceleration ramps

-  Deceleration ramps

-  Back-up speed

-  Back-up buzzer

For each parameter, the modification is recorded after clicking on
« Quit & Save ».

This function is protected by a password level 2.

The operator could decrease the speeds in order to check the
securities : this can simulate, a fault without taking any risk. For
instance, by decreasing the overspeed under the nominal speed, we can
test the efficiency of the security in overspeed, because the
Motosuiveur® braking is done without exceeding the nominal speed.

Preventive maintenance 
-----------------------

To be sure of the Motosuiveur® reliability, it is important to check the
following points :

**Every year :**

-  Visual inspection of the MS Torque Limiter (no important oxydation
   marks)

-  Checking of the oil level through the breather cap.

-  Visual inspection of the reaction arm (fixation, welds, cracks,
   etc.).

-  Visual inspection of the touchscreen display

-  Checking the availability of the back-up devices (handle and
   hydraulic wrench).

-  Periodic tests

**Every 5 years :**

-  Oil change of the Motosuiveur®.

-  Changing of the Motosuiveur® belt.

**Every 10 years :**

-  Checking of the Motosuiveur® gears (through the inspection cover).

-  Checking of electrical connections.

-  Dust removal in electrical cabinet.

-  Replacement of seals and elastomer washers.

Advises for maintenance operations
----------------------------------

   |image66|\ *The casing plug cover (see figure 4) should never be
   dismantled, except by a person qualified by SIGUREN technologies. The damping
   chamber is calibrated by SIGUREN technologies according to the installation
   specifications. After calibration, the casing plug cover is riveted
   to prevent its dismantling. Every cover removal by an unauthorized
   operator will void warranty.*

Oil change
~~~~~~~~~~

The following sketch shows the locations of holes for oil changing and
filling.

|image67|

|image68|

   |image69|

   *During this operation, take care not to introduce any particle
   inside the Motosuiveur®.*

   *Use only the oil* **ELAN EPX 75W80**\ *. The use of another oil may
   lead to a serious dysfuntion.*

*This operation is similar to drain a vehicle brake and should be done
by a qualified person. The procedure is as follows :*

|image70|

-  Power off the machine.

-  Remove the protection cover of the worm screw of the Motosuiveur® and
   its 3 fixation screws.

-  Set-up the manual command handle.

-  Set-up a oil container

-  Open the cap and let the oil pouring

-  Rotate the screw by turning slowly the handle in the lifting
   direction until the stop, in order to empty the hydraulic chamber

-  Change the cap seal if damaged

-  Replace the oil cap

-  Fill oil into Motosuiveur® until the maximum level (above the
   Motosuiveur® wheel) – approximately 8 litres.

-  Rotate the screw to the opposite direction by turning slowly the
   handle in lowering until the stop.

-  Drain the hydraulic chamber as described in §‎3.9”Drain of the
   hydraulic system”

-  Remove the handle

-  Put the protection cover back in place with its 3 fixation screws

-  Power on the Motosuiveur® (an autodiagnostic test is launched
   automatically)

|image71|

   *A loose drain screw can result in an insufficient braking and damage
   the Motosuiveur®.*

Belt changing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image72|

-  Power off the installation.

-  Disassemble the screws of the pulley casing cover

-  Disassemble the current belt

-  Remove the dust from parts

-  Loosen the motor fixation screws

-  Mount the new belt

-  Tighten **manually** the belt by moving the motor (the tensioning
   force should be low : a manual tensioning is sufficient).

-  Tighten the motor screws

-  Reassemble the pulley casing cover with its screws

-  Power on the installation

Replacement of seals and elastomer washers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This replacement should be done by a person qualified by SIGUREN technologies.

Functionning after an incident or a accident
============================================

General remarks
---------------

During an incident or a accident, The Motosuiveur® stops the load. The
purpose is to be able to lower the load, through the « back-up mode »
(procedures 3 to 7).

Various back-up modes allowable depending on the situation
----------------------------------------------------------

This function is used when an incident occurs. The back-up could be done
whatever the case, safely, by acting simultaneously on the two kinematic
chains, by available means. Whatever the case, safety is always ensured
because :

-  the Motosuiveur\ :sup:`®` brakes automatically above 0,5 m/min (50 %
   of the high speed).

-  At 0,3 m/min (30 % of nominal speed) : alarm + flashing lamp are
   activated to inform the operator.

The **procedures n° 4 to 8** help the operator on the actions to be
done\ **.**

The following table sums-up the various situations encountered and the
solutions to back-up the load :

Periodic tests 
===============

All the tests are done without load (only the hook and reeving block),
by plugging the testing box to the installation.

Service brake test
------------------

The purpose is to compare the results that we had during SAT part 2 and
the annual results. The braking is done only by the service brake (no
braking through MS).

Make a test in *raising* at high speed (1 m/min). Stop the movement
normally and record the braking curve (speed at HS shaft). Determine the
braking time. -> same procedure than “service brake qualification UP” of
SAT part 2.

Make a test in *lowering* at high speed (1 m/min). Stop the movement
normally and record the braking curve (speed at HS shaft). Determine the
braking time. -> same procedure than “service brake qualification DOWN”
of SAT part 2.

Test criteria :

-  Braking time = 0,75 s +20% -10%

-  Stopping distance at hook < 20 mm

-  No activation of both Motosuiveurs

MS braking test
---------------

The purpose is to compare the results that we had during SAT part 2
(tests n°19 and n°7, n°5 and n°8, see “SAT tests and inspection sequence
plan”) and the annual results. The braking is done by simultaneous
activation of both MS.

Simultaneous brakings :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make a test case n°19 in *raising* at high speed (1 m/min). Stop the
movement by simultaneous activation of both MS and record the braking
curve (speed at reducer output shaft, speed at motor shaft, MS
activation signal). Determine the braking time and compare the curves.

-  same procedure than “test case n°19” of previous SAT part 2

Make a test case°7 in *lowering* at high speed (1 m/min). Stop the
movement by simultaneous activation of both MS and record the braking
curve (speed at reducer output shaft, speed at motor shaft, MS
activation signal). Determine the braking time and compare the curves.

-  same procedure than “test case n°7” of previous SAT part 2

Non-simultaneous brakings :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make a test case n°5 in *raising* at high speed (1 m/min). Stop the
movement by activation of both MS-1 (and after MS-2) and record the
braking curve (speed at reducer output shaft, speed at motor shaft, MS
activation signal). Determine the braking time and compare the curves.

-  same procedure than “test case n°5” of previous SAT part 2, for MS-1
   then MS-2 (2 tests)

Make a test case°8 in *lowering* at high speed (1 m/min). Stop the
movement by activation of MS-1 (and after MS-2) and record the braking
curve (speed at reducer output shaft, speed at motor shaft, MS
activation signal). Determine the braking time and compare the curves.

-  same procedure than “test case n°8” of previous SAT part 2, for MS-1
   then MS-2 (2 tests)

.. _autodiagnostic-tests-1:

Autodiagnostic tests
--------------------

The purpose is to compare the results that we had during SAT part 2 and
the annual results.

Make 3 autodiagnostics tests and record after each test the results per
MS.

-  same procedure than “diagnostic” of SAT part 2

Procedures
==========

Procedure n° 1 : Password entry
-------------------------------

When the following window appears, the operator should enter the
suitable password (see §‎4.9 “Password and user rights”)

   |image73|

1. Type the password according to the level indicated in the window (1,
   2 or 3)

2. press “ENT”

*Comments :*

-  To quit the password menu, click on “ESC”.

-  To erase the last digit, press “BS”

-  To erase all digits, press “CLR”

-  For security reasons, when a password is entered, the authorization
   is given during 5 minutes for the access of each level. After 5
   minutes, the operator should enter the password again.

-  The required password level is the minimum level asked to the
   operator (for instance, when level 2 is required, the operator can
   enter level 2 or level 3).

Procedure n° 2 : Fault reset
----------------------------

When a fault occurs, the buzzer and the flashing light are activated.
Furthermore, « FAULT (see) » appears in the MS1 or MS2 window.

By clicking on “FAULT (see)”, the fault number appears (see appendix 2
for fault list). This operation needs at least a password entry level 1.

By clicking on “?”, an explanation of the fault and the solution to
solve it can be displayed.

The operator has to reset the fault by clicking on “Reset”.

|image74|

|image75|

|image76|\ |image77|

**Comments :**

-  When the fault is reset, an autodiagnostic is launched automatically.

-  The window “Fault number” disappear after 10 s (click on “Fault
   (see)” to see it again)

-  In the MS-2 menu, if the Motosuiveur n°1 is in fault, a message “MS-1
   in fault” is displayed in “Infos” windows (and vice versa).

|image78|

Procedure n° 3 : Manual release
-------------------------------

If the automatic release procedure is not successful, the operator needs
to release the system manually. The following window is shown :

|image79|

1. Press “launch”

2. Do a slight movement in the opposite direction of the previous
   movement, by the joystick

Generally, the manual release procedure has to be done when the load is
fully supported by the Motosuiveur.

The manual release has to be done at low speed otherwise the line
contactor is open (not possible to move the main motor of the crane).

*NOTA : After a release procedure, an autodiagnostic is launched
automatically then it switches back to “normal mode”.*

Procedure n° 4 : Back-up by manual action of the service brake 
---------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure has to be followed in case of main motor fault. The
following procedure allows the operator to switch in back-up up mode
with manual opening of the service brake.

   **Comments** :

-  This procedure requires two operators (one for the manual service
   brake opening, the second one at the MS-1 cabinet).

-  Ensure power to the motor is removed.

-  Each of the two operators can stop the operation : the first operator
   by closing the service brake, the other operator by stopping the
   rotation of MS-1 or MS-2.

-  This procedure can be launched either after a fault reset, or
   directly by the main menu.

-  To switch back to normal mode, the Motosuiveur® cabinet needs to be
   powered off. then powered again (an autodiagnostic is then launched
   automatically).

-  A password level 2 is needed

|image80|\ |image81|\ |image82|

|image83|

   **Operator actions :**

   Operator n°1 : Switch to “back-up” mode as shown above, for both MS-1
   and MS-2.

   Operator n° 2 : open the service brake step by step until the load
   moves at a certain speed. If the load speed exceeds 0,3 m/min (30 %
   of the nominal speed), a buzzer is activated.

   If the load speed exceeds 0,5 m/min (50 % of the nominal speed), the
   Motosuiveur® stops.

   *Because of the slow speed, it is easy to stop the action on the
   service brake before the Motosuiveur® worm is completely entered. The
   operation could be continued without additional action because the
   worm is automatically repositioned.*

   *In case of hard blocking, it should be possible to release the
   Motosuiveur® by using the handle (*\ **procedure 5**\ *).*

   *NOTA : to switch back to “normal mode”, it is necessary to power-off
   then power-on the electrical cabinet.*

Procedure n° 5 : Back-up by manual action of the service brake and manual rotation of the Motosuiveur
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure has to be followed in case of one Motosuiveur® motor is
defective.

The lowering movement is controlled manually by the operators, through
the handle at each Motosuiveur® shaft.

   **Comments** :

-  This procedure requires three operators (one for the manual service
   brake opening, the two others at the MS-1 and MS-2 handles).

-  We have to take care to switch off the Motosuiveur® cabinet.

-  Each of the three operators can stop the operation : the first
   operator by closing the service brake, the two other operators by
   stopping the rotation of MS-1 or MS-2.

-  During this procedure, the lowering is controlled by the operator on
   the service brake. The other operator follows the movement and can
   always stop it.

1. Switch off the Motosuiveur® cabinet (The Motosuiveurs should be
   driven manually)

2. For each Motosuiveur, dismantle the worm covers

..

   |image84|

3. For each Motosuiveur, mount the two handles

..

   |image85|

4. The operator n°1 opens the service brake step by step. Meanwhile, the
   two other operators should follow the movement by rotating the
   handles.

..

   *NOTA : to switch back to “normal mode”, it is necessary to power-on
   the electrical cabinet.*

Procedure n° 6 : Back-up by forced lowering
-------------------------------------------

   This procedure has to be done in case of the main kinematic chain is
   not available (gear box or transmission shaft destruction).

   **Comment** :

-  The suitable hydraulic torque wrench system has to be used to drive
   the two Motosuiveur® shafts.

-  Only one operator is needed for this procedure.

-  Depending on the suspended load and the height of the load to lower,
   this operation could last several days.

|image86|

   **This procedure has to be done as a last resort. The other back-up
   procedures have to be prioritised because, in the forced lowering,
   the worm and the wheel are worn quickly.**

1. Switch off the Motosuiveur® cabinet

2. For each Motosuiveur, remove the worm cover

|image87|

3. For each Motosuiveur, mount the special nut with its *two* keys
   inside

..

   |image88|

4. For each Motosuiveur, mount the hydraulic wrench

..

   |image89|\ |image90|

5. Plug the two hydraulic wrenches to the hydraulic system

6. Lower the load until the ground

7. Inspect the Motosuiveur® (worm and wheel) and the crane

|image91|

   *After this operation, the Motosuiveur® must be disassembled and
   inspected by SIGUREN technologies.*

 Procedure n° 7 : Electrical / automatic back-up
------------------------------------------------

   This procedure is to be done when some small repetitive faults appear
   (autodiagnostic problems, disadjusments, etc.). It allows to move the
   load at a certain position at slow speed.

   **Comment** :

-  Only one operator is needed for this procedure.

-  A password level 2 is needed

-  If the fault concerns only one Motosuiveur, switch in “back-up” mode
   only the defective Motosuiveur.

-  During this procedure, the Motosuiveur® will automatically stop the
   movement by the overspeed protection (0,5 m/min).

|image92|\ |image93|\ |image94|\ |image95|

1. Switch to “back-up” mode as shown above, for MS-1 or/and MS-2

2. Operate the crane at low speed (raising or lowering) through the
   joystick.

..

   *NOTA : to switch back to “normal mode”, it is necessary to power-off
   then power-on the electrical cabinet.*

Procedure n°8 : Back-up when the service brake does not hold the load
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure has to be followed in case of service brake slippage. In
this case, the two Motosuiveurs are locked. The following procedure
allows the operator to release the Motosuiveurs and to lower the load.

   **Comments** :

-  This procedure requires one operator

-  A password level 2 is needed

|image96|

   **Operator actions :**

1. Switch to “back-up” mode as shown above, for both MS-1 and MS-2.

2. Raise in low speed to unblock the Motosuiveur® (short movement is
   enough) then lower quickly in low speed. Keep the movement until the
   end.

..

   *NOTA : to switch back to “normal mode”, it is necessary to power-off
   then power-on the electrical cabinet.*

Procedure n°9 : Parameter modification
--------------------------------------

This procedure allows the operator to test some securities by changing
parameters (speeds, overspeeds, acceleration ramps, deceleration ramps,
back-up speed, back-up buzzer).

A password level 3 is required.

1. Authorize the movement through user interface as shown below, for
   MS-1 or/and MS-2

|image97|

|image98|\ |image99|

|image100|

2. Choose the parameter to modify

3. Enter the value then click “✔”

4. Check that the value is correctly entered (the value on the right
   should have changed)

..

   |image101|

5. Modify all the other needed parameters

6. Click on “Click & save” (no modification is taken into account
   before)
