Presentation of the Motosuiveur® System
=======================================

Application of the Motosuiveur System
-------------------------------------

The MS Unit is a failsafe mechanical hoist arrester, designed and
manufactured by Siguren. The MS Unit protects against failures in hoist
drive trains that would otherwise lead to dropped loads or overloads.

The MS consists of an irreversible worm and wheel gearbox mounted
directly to the hoist drum. It is a permissive system which allows the
drum to rotate at any speed within the hoist’s normal operating
parameters. Under fault conditions a differential speed between the worm
and wheel will cause the system to mechanically lock and the damping
system safely arrests the load. This provides mechanical failsafe
protection in the event of any electro-mechanical failure of the hoist
drive train. The typical arrangement is shown in **Figure 1** below. In
addition to the unit, a MS Torque Limiter is put in the drive-train to
limit the maximum load into the MS Unit. The MS Units are available in
multiple variants; hydraulic damping or friction plate arresting, shaft
mounted or foot mounted each with various load capacities. The units are
available in sizes 0 to 8 which equate to increasing equivalent drum
loads. The subject of this document is the MS size 3 – hydraulic
version, which is capable of braking torques of 32.0kN each with the
barrel rotating at up to 30rpm (based on 120% over-speed limit of 36rpm)

Design and Functioning Principle
--------------------------------

Typically, the MS Unit attaches to the drum via a stub shaft beyond the
bearing and torque is restrained via a torque arm. This arrangement is
shown in Figure 3.

The MS consists of a machined steel casing within which resides a worm
gear and associated wheel both of steel. Also within the casing are
numerous other components which allow the unit to function. The wheel is
splined internally and is connected to an equivalently splined shaft
attached to the crane drive train to transmit torque and via plain
bearings between the shaft and wheel to support the interface radially.
The wheel interface is by means of a plain bearing mounted between the
wheel and casing for radial support and the wheel interacts directly
with the casing for lateral and axial loads. The worm and wheel interact
in a standard manner, with the mesh such that nominal clearance is
achieved and that the wheel cannot force rotation on to the worm. The
worm bears onto the casing directly and is thus supported laterally and
radially. Axial restraint is provided by a small indent plunger which
holds the worm in place where the normal servo motor torque is applied
(i.e. under normal conditions). Extending from the worm in one direction
is a shaft with a splined surface, this interfaces with a bevel gear
with an internal spline and is axially free to translate along the worm
shaft. Meshing with the bevel gear is its reciprocal gear which is
rigidly fixed to a servo motor, itself mounted to the casing. This motor
provides rotation to the worm via the bevel gear arrangement at a
pre-set torque. The worm imparts this torque onto the wheel through its
mesh. The motor is actuated when the hoist operation is requested at the
Human-Mechanical Interface (HMI) for the crane. When the servo motor
actuates it allows the worm to impart torque onto the wheel but this
torque is insufficient to allow the crane drive to actuate, instead
allowing the wheel to rotate with the drum shaft through the normal
crane drive. Finally, to complete the moment couple between the drum
shaft and the MS Unit, a steel torque arm mounts between the unit and
the crane body.

|image3|

Figure 3: - MS6 in a Typical Hoist Arrangement

The servo motor is selected to have a maximum torque sufficient to allow
this movement up to a set maximum hoisting speed, normally 1.20 the
normal hoist speed. Beyond this speed the torque losses within the
system cause the worm to rotate at a lower equivalent speed to the worm
at which point the wheel will attempt to drive the worm. As it is a
non-backdriving system, when the wheel applies a torque to the worm this
is transferred to a translational load in the worm’s axial direction.
When the axial load is applied it overcomes the restraining force of the
indent plungers and the worm will translate. The worm then transfers
this load into one of two pistons mounted inside the case in line with
the worm (depending on which direction the hoist is moving and therefore
which direction the worm will move). In the downward direction the
piston consists of two chambers with restricted flow between the two. As
the piston is moved, oil is forced between the chambers, effectively
acting as a dashpot damper. This provides a restorative force onto the
worm, back through the wheel and into the crane drive system as a torque
opposing the rotation of the drive. This acts to slow the rotation of
the hoist. Finally, the piston impacts on an elastomer stack whose
restorative force increases with compression until the hoist is brought
to a halt. The geometry is such that the worm can translate in this
manner until the wheel (and therefore the crane drum) has rotated by
thirty (30) degrees. In the upwards direction, the piston acts directly
on an elastomer stack initially as the load on the hoist is already
acting against the rotation. As the effective wheel torque is lower the
initial damping is not required but is subsequently used as the hoist
drive is cut and the load settles in the downward direction.

The MS servo motor is configured, via servo controller, to operate in
torque control and when commanded simply applies a small rotational
torque to the worm. The amount of torque applied is sufficient to
accelerate the worm to follow the action of the wheel but it is not
sufficient to drive the wheel and is notionally 1:1000 of the rated MS
drum torque. As the speed of the hoist barrel increases under drive from
the hoist motor the wheel within the MS accelerates accordingly. The
worm, being free to accelerate or decelerate under the applied torque,
will increase in rotational velocity to allow it to follow the rotation
of the wheel.

Under normal operation the worm is designed to ‘float’ around a nominal
central location with respect to the wheel. The worm position is
monitored via two limit switches; these switches indicate that the worm
is correctly located before the MS gives a ‘hoist enabled’ output. Under
normal operating conditions the worm will remain between these two limit
switches therefore the only time these switches are initiated is on MS
activation. At power on or after MS activation the MS will perform a
self-test before allowing the ‘hoist enable’ command to be set. During
the self-test (the hoist is stationary and service brake applied) the
worm is manually moved up and down within the damping chamber under the
control of the torque applied by the servo motor. Since the wheel is
effectively locked by the hoist brake, rotating the worm will cause the
worm to react against the wheel and hence slide, up or down the chamber
depending on the direction of rotation. The self-test function checks
for correct operation of these limit switches, free worm rotation, the
amount of play in the system and for the presence of the oil.

|image4|

Figure 4: Image Showing Suggested MS Torque Limiter Placement

When the MS activates the worm moves out of normal operating position
and the limit switches drop out a ‘hoist enable’ interlock to the main
hoist drive motor circuit thereby stopping all hoisting functions.
Depending on the hoisting drive train characteristics, it is possible
that the MS Unit will arrest the load before the drive torque has been
fully removed. In this case, or in the case of a hoist control system
failure to prevent application of an over torque the MS is also paired
with a torque limiting device, located between the hoist motor and the
input shaft of the gearbox. This limits the torque the motor can impart
and dissipates any excess rotational inertia generated in the load train
during the arrest cycle.

The torque limiting device is set to slip at a nominal value equivalent
to that of 10% above hoist proof load. This allows all hoisting
functions to operate without interference while protecting the hoist
mechanism from any overloads or shock loads. It is a long spring
friction MS Torque Limiter that delivers constant torque limit while
slipping with negligible change in slipping torque through life. The
recommended position of the MS Torque Limiter is shown in Figure 4 (i.e.
between motor and gearbox).

The servo motor driving the worm has the ability to supply a constant
torque up to its nominal operating speed (i.e. 3000rpm). Above that
speed the torque capability drops sharply and thus the speed of the worm
is physically limited by the mechanics of the drive hence it is not
possible for the MS to allow an overspeed condition. As the maximum
servo motor speed is exceeded the drive torque drops therefore the worm
cannot overcome the rotational friction generated by the oil, hence the
wheel will try to overtake the worm causing the worm and wheel to lock,
arresting the wheel rotation.

Control of the MS is provided via a servo motor controller with a small
amount of integrated control logic. The control logic is used to monitor
limit switch status, set and monitor servo motor performance and
interface with a small HMI. The HMI is used during setup and fault
diagnosis, it is not required during normal operations.

Main Characteristics
--------------------

Mechanical Characteristics of the Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The nameplate of the Motosuiveur® indicates the maximum rotating speed
and the corresponding braking torque.

|image5|

Figure 5: Typical MS nameplate

   |image6|\ The Motosuiveur® is factory set taking into account the
   speed, load and inertia of the equipment. Increasing the speed /
   inertia of the equipment on which the Motosuiveur® is installed is
   not allowed and may lead to serious damage.

Delivery, Handling, Storage
===========================

Important Comment
-----------------

The Motosuiveur® is designed to resist the dynamic force of a defined
application; so before putting into operation, make sure that the
installation complies entirely with the application that the
Motosuiveur® has been designed for by checking the nameplate.

Appearance of a New Motosuiveur
-------------------------------

On delivery check that all the following parts are present or already
mounted and operational:

-  The Motosuiveur®

-  The breather cap

-  The electric cabinet

-  The supply cables

-  The MS Torque Limiter

On receipt, check for any in–transit damage.

 

|image7|

   The Motosuiveur® of the installation is attached to a MS Torque Limiter
   rated to a value specifically calculated for your application.
   Similarly, the control cabinet containing equipment which is pre-set
   to the specific values of your application must not be modified.

Handling
--------

All Motosuiveur®, are controlled after assembly, set and tested on
bench. During those tests, the oil fill is adjusted and the hydraulic
system is drained. To prevent draining the system on activation, the
Motosuiveur® must be carried in horizontal position, with the cap in top
position.

|face8ms|

|image8|

|image9|

|cote-ms|

Before any handling, check:

-  The correct balancing of the load,

-  The handling equipment capacity and compare it to the load to lift.

-  That the slings and straps do not lean on fragile parts (pipes,
   diverse accessories, etc.) and that they do not damage the surface
   treatment applied on our products.

|image10|

Never lift a Motosuiveur® by the motor.

Storage
-------

In order to ensure good preservation conditions the following storage
recommendations should be observed:

(In case of ship transportation, the packaging must be waterproof and
have a humidity absorbing properties). The equipment must also be stored
in a dry place, away from adverse weather conditions and any temperature
variation ensuring it is placed on an insulated paper covered wooden
base.

Short Period Storage (Less Than 3 Months)
-----------------------------------------

After the tests and the final checks, the manufactured parts of the
Motosuiveur® must be protected with a long term corrosion preventative
coating. The oil fill up must be adjusted to the level indicator. In
this condition, they can be stored in vertical position, without any
intervention during 3 months. Beware not to damage the protected finish.

Medium Period Storage (Less Than 1 Year)
----------------------------------------

For a storage period of 3 to 12 months, the Motosuiveur® must be
completely filled with the oil designed for the required application.

This oil will be drained off to the level indicator before use. There
will be no need to rinse it. During emptying, beware not to go under the
level indicator otherwise the system may need to be drained.

Long Period Storage (Less Than 5 Years)
---------------------------------------

For a storage period longer than 12 months, to 5 years, it is
recommended to drain the Motosuiveur® then pour or spray ARDROX IV 2
(supplier Brent) into the machine (5 % of the total volume).

-  This is a volatile corrosion inhibitor additive for standard
   lubricating oils.

-  Its vapour phase protects surfaces which are not in contact with the
   liquid phase.

-  Its liquid phase increases the corrosion protection properties of the
   oil in which it is dissolved.

For A Medium or a Long Period of Storage
----------------------------------------

With the corrosion inhibitors being volatile during the storage period
make sure the inside of the Motosuiveur® is insulated/protected against
any atmospheric. In particular, the breather caps must be replaced by
hermetic caps. The maintenance door must be hermetically closed.

Every 3 months:

-  Rotate the PV wheel (at least 1 turn) manually.

-  Check the protective long term corrosion protective surface.

Protection of the Manufactured Parts
------------------------------------

The manufactured surfaces are delivered protected by a long term
corrosion preventative coating (standard casing). Except if there is
some deterioration to the surface, there is no need for another
protective coating application.

Product used: ARDROX 3140. (For data sheet see Appendix 5)

Installation
============

Safety Instructions
-------------------

-  The Motosuiveur® is designed to resist the dynamic force of a defined
   application; so before any putting in operation, make sure that the
   installation complies entirely with the application which the
   Motosuiveur® has been designed for.

-  Before any operation on the equipment, switch off the electrical
   supply and ensure that the load cannot move.

-  Never place your hands inside the Motosuiveur®, without being sure
   that the rotation of the shafts is impossible.

-  Never rotate the Motosuiveur® if the maintenance door is open or/and
   if the protection cover of the MS Torque Limiter is removed.

-  Do not modify the machine. Any modification of the kinematic chain
   increasing the inertias, the limiter adjustments or the maximum
   speeds can be dangerous.

-  All work must be carried out by competent staff with appropriate
   training.

Read carefully the special safety instructions on Appendix 1.

In this document, all comments preceded by: |image11| are about safety.

Environment
-----------

A Motosuiveur® is a safety instrument, thus it needs regular maintenance
checks. So it has to be easily accessible.

In particular, the following conditions should be observed:

-  Ensure accessibility.

-  Ensure the safety of the maintenance staff.

-  Protect the equipment against a too polluting environment.

-  Allow a normal air admission necessary to a good thermal exchange.

-  Ensure acceptable temperature (from -10° C to 40° C).

-  IP65 rating should not be exceeded

-  A sheltered working location.

-  The electric control panel containing the operating console must be
   easy to reach. It is better if it is next to the Motosuiveur® and
   visible by an operator. If it is not feasible, install a buzzer near
   the Motosuiveur® to gravity lowering operations with the service
   brake of the main hoist motor.

-  Make sure that the electric cables between the Motosuiveur® and the
   electric boxed set are not subject to chemical or mechanical
   aggressions.

-  Make sure that no heat source is in direct contact with the
   Motosuiveur®.

-  The Motosuiveur® must be filled with oil (SW15 see Appendix 5)

Assembly of the MS Unit
-----------------------

For the correct installation of the Motosuiveur®, to avoid ill-timed
blockings during the setting of the command station and of the drives,
we advise you to start the winch assembly following these steps:

-  Mount the MS Torque Limiter

-  Set and test the lifting drive and the command cabinet

-  Installation of the Motosuiveur® on the drum and its torque arm

-  Position of the manual commands

-  Oil level check

-  Electric linking of the Motosuiveur®

|image12|

   The Motosuiveur® should never be engaged without its MS Torque Limiter.
   This would cancel all guaranties.

Assembly of the MS Torque Limiter
------------------------------

The installation is equipped with a RN-EL 40 MS Torque Limiter (VEKO).

See Appendix 2 for technical sheet.

-  The MS Torque Limiter is mounted between the hoist motor and the High
   Speed shaft of the gear box

-  Assembly must be done by qualified operators.

-  The MS Torque Limiter is delivered factory rated to the value necessary
   to the application. In case of doubt, check the application data on
   the assembly drawing.

-  The limiter assembly direction is defined on the layout.

-  The MS Torque Limiter coupling is made of:

-  The permanent spring limiter

-  The driving hub

|image13|

Figure 4: MS Torque Limiter

The response curve of the helical springs is maintained and the pressure
force applied to the linings is constant regardless of the degree of
wear. Any fluctuation of the pre-set torque is insignificant and it is
the number of springs which defines the rating torque.

   |image14|\ The limiter supplied is rated specifically for the
   application it is intended to be used; the limiter part should never
   be dismantled. Never add nor withdraw a spring during normal
   functioning of the winch. You would be taking an important risk of
   damaging the equipment and all guaranties would be lost. Any
   maintenance operation should be done by SIGUREN technologies or an authorized
   representative.

Setting and Tests on the Drives
-------------------------------

It is preferable that before the Motosuiveur® is assembled, the
following settings and tests are performed on the hoist drives:

-  The acceleration ramps

-  The deceleration ramps

-  The opening of the service brake of the main hoist motor against the
   motor torque

-  The closing of the service brake of the main hoist motor against the
   motor speed

-  The thresholds of the fixed speeds

-  The minimum and maximum speeds

-  The Motosuiveur® is programmed to brake as soon as the maximum and
   minimum thresholds are exceeded for each of these values.

If when engaged, the drive is not correctly set, the Motosuiveur® will
automatically brake, until the correct value is obtained.

Setting-up on the Drum
----------------------

To avoid having to do a new drain of system before putting it in
service, the Motosuiveur® must be transported in the authorised
positions shown above.

   |image15|\ Before setting it up, check the way the Motosuiveur® is
   positioned the right way. A wrongly positioned Motosuiveur® cancels
   all guarantees.

   The right way is indicated by an arrow on the side of the
   Motosuiveur®.

The arrow indicates the direction of spin of the Motosuiveur® during the
lowering of the load.

Lubrication
-----------

All our Motosuiveur®, are checked after assembly, set and tested on
bench at Siguren. During those tests, the oil tank is filled, the level
is adjusted and the hydraulic system is drained (oil quantity =
0.6 litre).

|image16|\ |image17|

Figure 5: Breather cap

After the torque arm set-up:

-  Clean if necessary the upper side of the Motosuiveur®.

-  Unscrew it and check the oil level.

-  Screw the breather cap completely.

..

   |image18|\ During this operation, make you do not introduce any
   particle in the Motosuiveur®

   Use only the **SW15** oil. Using oil other than specified can cause
   the unit to malfunction.

Drain of the Hydraulic System
-----------------------------

After each operation of the Motosuiveur® an auto diagnostic programme is
run to check that there is no air within the damping chamber. If air is
detected, the damping chamber has to be drained. This operation must be
carried out by a qualified operator

Procedure:

-  Make sure the hoist is empty

-  Make sure the oil level is sufficient

-  Make a movement down at slow speed until the movement stops (the
   MS Torque Limiter is slipping)

-  Make a movement up at slow speed until the movement stops (the torque
   limiter is slipping)

-  Repeat these two operations seven times

-  Power on the Motosuiveur® (an automatic auto diagnostic is launched)

-  If the auto diagnostic ends with a fault, repeat the procedure

Electrical Connection and Signals of the Motosuiveur®

Proface HMI Touch Screen Operations
===================================

Touch Screen access
-------------------

The Motosuiveur® control system uses a touchscreen attached to the
logics controller (Proface from Digital Electronics Corp).

The display has two functions:

-  Display data and main information.

-  Configure the Motosuiveur® system. Configuration is always protected
   with PIN according to the required level of authorization and
   requires a qualified operator.

Before using the Motosuiveur® system the settings which must be
configured are:

-  Quick stop delay time

-  MS directions for back up mode (System commissioning by Siguren or
   SEQP Engineer)

These settings are saved in case of the de-energizing and removal of the
power to the panel.

The display screen possesses its own parameter settings that can be
accessed in offline mode. This mode is accessed by touching the upper
right corner of the screen just followed by a touch on the lower left
corner.

Password Entry
--------------

When the following window appears, the operator should enter the
suitable password

Required level

|image20|

-  Type the password according to the level indicated in the window (1,
   2 or 3) and then press “ENT”

Comments:

-  See “User rights” to check the rights and authorized access depending
   on the entered password

-  To quit the password menu, click on “ESC”

-  To erase the last digit, press “BS”

-  To erase all digits, press “CLR”

-  To switch from lower case to capital letters (or back), press “CAPS”

-  For security reasons, when a password is entered, the authorization
   is given during 5 minutes for the access of each level. After 5
   minutes, the operator should enter the password again

-  The required password level is the minimum level asked to the
   operator (for instance, when level 2 is required, the operator can
   enter level 2 or level 3)

-  If the password is wrong, this screen is displayed.

|image21|

-  Press the cross sign (in the lowest right part)

-  Press “CLR” and enter the password again

Offline Mode
------------

Offline mode is accessed by pointing upper right corner of the screen
followed by touching lower left corner of the screen.

Offline mode gives access to various platform settings and checking.

Time Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image22|\ Enter offline mode, and touch the [Date and Time] button.

The display unit clock can be updated periodically or at a specified
timing. By using this feature, time adjustment in offline mode is
unnecessary.

Proface HMI Touch Screen Battery Life
-------------------------------------

The touch screen’s battery’s lifetime has a 10-years guaranty certified
by the manufacturer.

When the installation is out of power, the battery allows the touch
screen to store the date, time, the events record and the functioning
time for approximately 3 months. Afterwards the data may be lost.

The full charge time of a totally discharged battery is 96 hours.

+----------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+

The section describes the way to follow to enter a password and the user

The different modes and functions accessible are the following sections:

:mark:`

Selecting the Operating Modes
-----------------------------

The selection of the operating modes is the equivalent of the use of the
Normal mode/Recovery mode/backup mode selection hard button on the main
control panel.

The access to that screen requires permission level 3 password and this
operation is to be handled by expert operators exclusively.

|image33|

The principle of the Motosuiveur® makes it possible to have the 3
operating modes selected either independently, or in a combination of
those modes. The selection can be done on the control panel with the 3
position selection button or with the 3 switches on the HMI by software.

Operating modes button gives access to the node selection buttons. Upper
lights are an image of the selection on the main panel.

This screen is normally accessed as a backup solution when hard control
buttons are not accessible or the main panel is not operating.

The display shows the selection made from the main panel with red
lights.

The position of the soft buttons indicates the selection that is really
applied to the system. This means that the last action is the actual
action.

At the opening of the screen the lights that symbolize the position of
the selection buttons on the remote main panel and the switches are
synchronized.

When the operator selects a soft switch position on the screen that is
different from the main panel selection, his/her action overrides the
selection button on the main panel.

|image34| Installation with recovery motors. Example of selections made
from the main panel and how they are reflected on the screen. When
"Backup" or "Recovery" are selected an arrow button appears to allow the
access to the corresponding operation screen.

The switches and the lights remain asynchronised until their positions
are updated on the main panel or on the screen.

If the selection of the selection button on the main panel changes, the
switches and the lights change accordingly giving the user a correct
view of the selection on the main panel

|image35|

Installation with 2 recovery motors. Example of a difference of
selection between the main panel and the screen. The valid operating
mode is Recovery on, Normal off and Backup off. Since this installation
is equipped with 2 recovery motors, a field allows the capture of the
maximum allowed position between both recovery motors.

Normal Mode
-----------

The crane runs normally through the standard joystick, as long as the
speeds and accelerations are observed.

In this mode, the control system checks in real time the movement
direction, the accelerations and the speeds (including during load stop
and even when there is no speed reference given to the system).

In case of fault, the Motosuiveur® units ensure security by stopping the
movement. A fault message is displayed. It is then possible to know the
fault number and to reset it from the hoist reset button.

Back up mode
------------

The backup mode is available for **Siguren engineers use only** and is
intended to allow hoist movements in some special situations.

When back up mode is activated:

-  The MS motor speed is physically limited

-  All MS logic faults (over speed etc) are inhibited.

-  MS hoist enable signal is forced.

-  MS switches are inhibited.

Recovery Mode
-------------

The purpose of the recovery system is to provide an independent means of
enabling the raising or lowering the load in the event of a failure of
the main hoisting mechanism.

This means of hoisting is achieved and initiated either from the Siguren
control panel with physical buttons or from the Proface HMI located on
the control panel. For the purpose of explaining the recovery modes in
the following sections of the manual it is written that these activities
are completed using the HMI as the primary means of operator interaction
however these activities can be also driven from the main switches on
the panel door.

In order to complete a recovery process the persons completing this task
are required to be appropriately trained and authorized operators and be
given a password for level 3 authorisation in order to complete the
actions on the HMI.

Description of Recovery System Procedures and Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When deciding a recovery is required to be undertaken an assessment
should be made to establish where the fault has occurred as the MS
recovery can only occur if the hoist is mechanical drive chain is not
blocked by a mechanical means such as gearbox failure or service brake
failure. In the event the failure does permit the recovery the procedure
in the later chapters describes the process to be undertaken to complete
the recovery utilising the MS recovery drives. Whilst undertaking the
recovery process and in all cases the main motor hoist service brake is
required to be operable and correctly functioning, this will then be
required to be automatically opened by the hoist control system for the
entire duration of the recovery starting from when the clutch to permit
the recovery is engaged described in section 4.12.4.

The following cautions should also be observed during and following a
recovery

-  The main hoist should not be returned to service until the cause of
   the failure leading the requirement to complete the recovery has been
   identified and rectified.

|image36|

-  Following a maximum of 100m of recovery travel in both the upwards
   and downwards directions it is recommended that the MS Units undergo
   maintenance by the manufacturer.

-  After each use of the recovery mode, the hoist should run with no
   load at full speed up and down for at least 10 minutes thus allowing
   the magnets to clean the oil by removing metal particles.

Selecting the Recovery Mode from the Touch Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select the operating model using the HMI as described in section 4.9.

When the recovery mode is selected, either from the main control panel
selector or locally from the HMI touch screen the recovery selection
lets an arrow button appear underneath the recovery title.

In this application and with 2 Motosuiveurs and 2 recovery motors and
because the hoisting shaft is divided into two parts, connected together
with a gear, and a significant distance hoisting distance it may be
possible that an action on the recovery motors may not hoist up or down
synchronously on both recovery motors which could lead to the loss of
level on the unit being recovered. The maximum positional difference
between the two MS Units can be set in units measured and managed by the
Motosuiveur®. This maximum difference is set at factory at commissioning
and can be adjusted during site commissioning to suit the application.

Recovery motor clutch engagement with the load on the main hoist.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following selection of the recovery mode and with a failure mode where
the main hoist has failed in a loaded condition the following steps
should be undertaken using the HMI touch screen.

The steps to be undertaken to perform this activity are as follows:-

1. Select the recovery mode on the main panel, the arrow button gives
   the access to the engagement procedure screen.

2. Initiate the engagement cycle by depressing the yellow push button
   located on the front of the MS Unit panel. (Ref.15 004-100E – Button
   S1).

Note - For completing the engagement process, the controllers of the
recovery motors must be operational and the clutch engagement sensors
must be off to detect the engagement.

When the recovery motor controllers are not operational, the engagement
status light is blinking and turns on to red as shown.

|image37|

It should also be noted that the recovery motors are engaged one after
the other therefore the process of 2\ :sup:`nd` recovery engagement is
not started until the 1\ :sup:`st` engagement is completed fully.

Once the clutch engagement cycle is initiated the engagement status
light blinks orange and then turns to yellow when the engagement process
is complete.

|image38|

This is symbolized by half of the horizontal bar turning green and the
completion of the whole engagement phase is symbolized by the red
horizontal bar that turns green when the phase is complete.

|image39| |image40|

The duration of the engagement cycle is set in the “recovery” settings
menu by the manufacturer. It is typically set between 1 to 3 minutes per
recovery motor. If the engagement does not complete before the cycle
timeout, the “engagement” light on the control panel does not turn on
and the engagement status light turns to permanent red.

The screen shots below on the left show the status of the engagement of
the first recovery motor which has failed after reaching engagement
cycle timeout and the screen shot on the right shows the engagement of
the first recovery clutch but failed engagement of the second

|image41| |image42|

The failure of the engagement process is not a cause for concern as the
duration of the engagement process is variable and failure of the cycle
may be due to several variable factors however it is more probably due
to the engagement cycle timeout. If this situation occurs the repeat of
the clutch engagement cycle should be initiated again by the depressing
the yellow push button located on the front of the MS Unit panel (Ref.15
004-100E – Button S1). If after many several failed attempts the
engagement process does not complete guidance should be sought from
Siguren.

Operating Recovery from the Touch Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the engagement process is completed the hoist motor service brake
can be opened as the load is taken by the MS Unit. The recovery
operations can be completed from the touch screen located on the MS Unit
control panel. This allows the MS Unit to be able to perform up and down
operations using the recovery motors. These movements are initiated by
firstly accessing the hoisting operations screen on the HMI, this screen
is accessed by pressing the ‘To Recovery Operations’ button shown once
the clutch engagement cycle is completed. Following the pressing of this
button on the HMI screen a further screen is shown which displays the
recovery buttons. This screen also shows the condition of the sensors
monitoring the position of the screw [IS1 and IS2), clutch engagement
[ISN] and when recovery is selected [Recovery VAR]. When these switches
are activated they are highlighted green or in the case of recovery
possible this is also highlighted green.

|image43|

The recovery motors can they can be operated synchronously using the
middle up/down buttons or independently using the up and down buttons
either side of the of the synchronous up or down buttons.

Facility has been provided to allow either the recovery motors
independently to correct any level issue that may occur. The default
operation mode is the synchronous mode and the operation of the recovery
motions independently should be restricted to especial scenarios and
caution observed as the centre of gravity may shift therefore increasing
the load on individual chains.

Within the MS Unit control system the controller logic verifies that the
position of each Motosuiveur and compares the position of each MS Unit.
The position difference cannot exceed the maximum defined in the
“Recovery settings” or in the “Operating mode” screen when selected on
“Recovery” and it is protected by the logics.

If a physical position difference exists due to a failure and the
position difference exceeds the limit, the logic prevent hoisting
movement of each recovery motor in the direction that would increase the
difference whether the order is done independently or in sync. It should
be noted that the sync mode of the system keeps a potential difference
inside the limit whereas the individual up/down buttons are able to
initiate movement that can potentially exceeding the limits. The screen
shots below show the where the recovery is inside or outside of the
positional difference band.

|image44| |image45|

When the recovery this completed and the load is lowered a safe
supported position the recovery completion step can be completed.

Recovery Completion 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On completion of the recovery of the load the recovery clutch is
required to be disengaged. This is completed automatically by the MS
unit and instigated by the removal of the load from the units and the
mechanical drive chain. To do this when the load is lowered at the
desired position, continue to lower the load using the touch screen.
When the load can be seen to have been removed from the chains, still
continue to lower as this continues to move the screw. Do this until the
HMI ISN1 and ISN2 indication lamps are illuminated. Once this is the
achieved stop the lowering process as the screw is in a normal and
central position, then make a small upward movement. This upward
movement will remove the load from the recovery drive chain and then
clutch will be automatically disengaged and the recovery engaged lamp on
the MS control panel door will be switched off and the recovery
disengaged light will be switched on.

When the recovery drive is disengaged and the system is required to be
returned into normal mode. To do this power cycle the Motosuiveur®
control panel by turning off the supplies to the panel. When the power
is reinstated the HMI will be in normal mode and should initiate its
self-tests. Once these test successful and complete the hoist can be
used in normal operation however it is recommended that after every
recovery operation and prior to returning to normal service the hoist
should be run at a reduced load in the upwards and downwards direction
and at full speed to allow the oil to be cleaned by the in-built
magnets. It is also recommended that following recovery in the upwards
and downwards directions totalling 100mtrs that the MS Units undergo
maintenance by the manufacturer.

   |image46|\ After each use of the recovery mode, the hoist should run
   with a reduced load and at full speed up and down for at least 10
   minutes thus allowing the magnets to clean the oil by removing metal
   particles.

   Following a maximum of 100m of recovery travel in both the upwards
   and downwards directions it is recommended that the MS Units undergo
   maintenance by the manufacturer.
