 **GENERAL INFORMATION**
========================

**Introduction**
----------------

This manual is a specific compilation of design and engineering data for
the supply of one MotoSuiveur®, size 1, required for the disassembly of
slightly radioactive waste stock application.

This manual is intended for the Operator, Installation, Electrical,
Maintenance and Service personnel to use as a reference and guide.

The following sections advise the Manufacturers Recommended Procedures,
to minimise risk for the operation, service and maintenance of the
supplied equipment.

All instructions **MUST** be read and understood by all persons involved
in the installation, electrical connection, operation or maintenance of
the supplied equipment.

Proprietary information refering to motors, bearings or other additional
components will be included, these too must read and understood by
persons undertaking any task involving the supplied equipment.

The manufacturer has supplied the most upto date and complete
instructions possible within this manual. However the manufacturer
assumes no liability for any failure or damage resulting from this
document, if there is failure to observe the general safety instructions
and notices provided with or on the supplied equipment.

Modifications to the installed equipment **MUST** be recorded in the
Operation and Manaintenace Manual for future reference. Training records
of operators **Should** be recorded to ensure competancy.

The manufacturer designs all products with safety and purpose at the
forefront of the design. Every effort is made to ensure the safety of
operators and others.

Nevertheless there is significant risk of injury to the operators and
others including damage to the supplied equipment and surroundings if:

-  Operated by untrained personnel,

-  Used for purpose other than intended,

-  Improperly maintained or operated.

To ensure the manufacturer’s guarantees, a maintenance programme must be
formulated immediately after handover of the installation. The
maintenance programme **MUST** follow the periodic maintenance
guidelines of this document.

**Foreword**
------------

The MS Unit is a proprietary system for the protection of the
main hoist load from over-speed and load path failures, and for the
recovery of the load in the event of a failure. The unit is supplied
with a proprietary control panel from the equipment manufacturers. The
crane’s hardwired controls are interfaced to this panel to control the
MotoSuiveur® in normal operation.

The MS Unit is a failsafe mechanical hoist arrester, designed and
manufactured by Siguren Technologies LTD. The MS Unit protects against
failures in hoist drive trains that would otherwise lead to dropped
loads or overloads.

**Short description**
---------------------

The MotoSuiveur® (referred to for short MS) consists of an irreversible
worm and wheel gearbox (Figure 2, points 2 and 14) mounted directly to
the hoist drum (Figure 1). It is a permissive system which allows the
drum to rotate at any speed within the hoist’s normal operating
parameters. Under normal conditions the worm constantly pushes the
wheel. Under fault conditions a differential speed between the worm and
wheel will cause the system to mechanically lock and the friction or
damping system inside the MS safely arrests the load. This provides
mechanical failsafe protection in the event of any electro-mechanical
failure of the hoist drive train. In addition to the unit, a torque
limiter is put in the drive-train to limit the maximum load into the MS
unit.

The MS Units are available in multiple variants:

-  elastomer or hydraulic damping or friction plate arresting,

-  shaft mounted or foot mounted,

-  load bearing,

-  each with various load capacities according to size 0 to 7 which
   equate to increasing equivalent drum loads.

Product Description 
--------------------

The MS Unit consists of an irreversible worm and wheel gearbox mounted
directly to the hoist drum. It is a permissive system which allows the
drum to rotate at any speed within the hoist’s normal operating
parameters. Under fault conditions a differential speed between the worm
and wheel will cause the system to mechanically lock and the damping
system safely arrests the load.

MS Unit provides mechanical failsafe protection in the event of any
electro-mechanical failure of the hoist drive train. In addition to the
unit, a MS Torque Limiter is put in the drive-train to limit overload into
the hoist lifting mechanism.

The MS Units are available in multiple variants: hydraulic damping or
friction plate arresting, shaft mounted or foot mounted each with
various load capacities. The units are available in sizes 0 to 8 which
equate to increasing equivalent drum loads. The subject of this document
is the MS size 1 (hydraulic version), which is capable of braking
torques of up to 9500 Nm.

The MS1 unit attaches to the drum via a stub shaft. Torque is restrained
via dowel pins.

The MS consists of a machined steel casing, housing a streel worm gear
and associated wheel.

MS-secured hoist comprises of the following components shown on figure
1.1.

**Figure 2** MS Unit overview

The MS wheel (2) is internally splined and is connected to a splined
shaft attached to the crane drive train to transmit torque via plain
bearings between the shaft and wheel to support the interface radially.

The wheel interface consists of a plain bearing (3) mounted between the
wheel and casing for radial support where the wheel interacts directly
with the casing for lateral and axial loads. The worm (13) and wheel (2)
interact in a standard manner, with the mesh such that nominal clearance
is achieved and that the wheel cannot force rotation on to the worm.

The worm bears onto the casing directly and is supported laterally and
radially. Axial restraint is provided by a small indent plunger (16)
which holds the worm in place where the normal servo motor torque is
applied (i.e., under normal conditions). Extending from the worm in one
direction is a shaft with a splined surface, this interfaces with a
bevel gear (13) with an internal spline and is axially free to translate
along the worm shaft. Meshing with the bevel gear is its reciprocal
gear, which is rigidly fixed to a servo motor (7), itself mounted to the
casing.

This motor (7) provides rotation to the worm (14) via the bevel gear
(13) arrangement at a pre-set torque. The worm (13) conveys this torque
onto the wheel through its mesh. The motor (7) is actuated when the
hoist operation is requested. When the servo motor (7) actuates it
allows the worm (14) to convey the torque onto the wheel (2), but this
torque is insufficient to allow the crane drive to actuate, instead
allowing the wheel to rotate with the drum shaft through the normal
crane drive. Finally, to complete the moment couple between the drum
shaft and the MS Unit, a dowel pins mounts between the unit and the
crane body.

Handling
--------

1) All MS Units are controlled after assembly, set and tested on bench.
   During those tests, the oil fill is adjusted.

2) The damping chamber is bled and sealed. However, a certain quantity
   of air remains in the rest of the system. To prevent this air to
   penetrate inside the damping chamber during transportation, which can
   cause malfunction, the MS Units must be carried with the damping
   chamber in specific position for hydraulic MS Units.

3) During transportation MS Unit must be carried via transport rings
   (1), oil sensor (2) is oriented up and oil drain hole (3) down.

**Figure 5** Correct handling of MS

MS Torque Limiter 
---------------

Static and dynamic overloads damage components of the kinematic chain
and ropes, shortening their lifecycle and increasing the probability of
catastrophic breakage. Additionally, traditional emergency braking
constrains kinetic energy within the hoist’s drive train with the
resulting peak overloads reaching more than 5 times the static load
torque.

This classic mechanical problem would usually be solved by disengaging
the hoist motor from the kinematic chain above a certain torque. In
lifting applications however, the risk of a malfunction or
under-performance of the caliper safety brake is too high and hoist
designers implicitly rely on the whole drive train and service brakes as
a back-up, so it cannot be uncoupled safely.

On a MS-Secured hoist, the hoist’s kinematic chain plays no role in
holding the load during and after emergency arrests. Integrating a
MS Torque Limiter between the hoist motor and gearbox is now risk-free.

|                                   | SWL. This setting remains         |
|                                   | extremely stable even when        |

**MS SYSTEM OPEARTION**
=======================

Figure 10 presents the MS operating algorithm.

|A picture containing text, screenshot, diagram, line Description
automatically generated|

**Figure 9** MS operating algorithm

When the power is switched on, the MS starts with a check for an
activated Recovery mode. In case the Recovery mode is activated, MS
enters in Recovery operation mode. If the mode is inactive, MS starts a
self-test operation.

A self-test comprises a set of sequential tests that are designed to
verify the health of electrical and mechanical parts of MS. The steps of
the self-test are described in section 6.1.

Upon successful completion of the self-test, the MS enters following
mode. This is the normal MS operating mode. In this mode, the MC follows
the crane movements according to the preset input data - acceleration
and deceleration times (ramps), maximum drum speed. The following mode
is described in detail in section 6.2.

Errors may occur while following operation. These can be related to MS
operation (Table 5) - such as overspeed. They can also be system related
– for an example loss of power supply (Table 6). After a fault occurs,
regardless of its cause, it is necessary to troubleshoot it and restart
MotoSuiveur® System. Troubleshooting is described in sections 7 and 8.

If necessary during following, Recovery mode can be activated - section
6.3.

SELF-TEST
---------

A self-test is a procedure in which the MS Unit tests its health through
a sequence of tests (table 4). The self-test is performed after the
initial power-up of the MotoSuiveur® System or after a restart from the Reset
button (Section 6.3). on the electrical panel.

FOLLOWING
---------

The following mode is based on the principal diagram in Figure 3. In the
normal state, after a successful self-test and the presence of an enable
signal from the crane, the following indicators are active - Hoist
enabled, Upward enabled and Downward enabled (Figure 10).

|A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with low
confidence|

**Figure 10** Active indicators in following state

The following process is started after pressing the buttons to operate
the crane up or down. If a limit switch prohibiting upward movement is
activated during movement, the Upward enable indicator becomes inactive
- Figure 11. In this state, no upward movement of the crane is allowed,
and a short downward movement is required until the MS worm is cantered
- Figure 10.

medium confidence|

**Figure 11** Upward movement prohibited

Accordingly, if the limit switch prohibiting downward movement is
activated during movement, the Downward enabled indicator becomes
inactive – Figure 12. In this state, no downward movement of the crane
is allowed, and a short upward movement is required until the MS worm is
cantered – Figure 10.

**Figure 12** Downward movement prohibited

If the enable signal from hoist to the MS fails, the Hoist enabled
indicator becomes inactive. If the signal is inactive the MS does not
follow the crane on a motion request. Accordingly, the MS does not
transmit an enable signal to the crane.

|image28|

**Figure 13** No enable signal from crane

The states described above do not put the MS in a fault state. Fault
states can occur for a variety of reasons (overspeed detection, unwanted
movement detection, loss of power supply etc.). When the crane is
requested to move, the MS starts to follow in the direction it is
needed. During following, the MS checks for exceeding the maximum
permissible hoist speed. When the MS detects that the defined speed is
exceeded, it trips, Fault indicator became active, Hoist enabled
indicator became inactive and prevents the hoist from moving. Downward
enable and Upward enable are ignored in fault state.

**Figure 14** MS fault state

After MS enters a fault state, an operator response is required to
identify the reason for the fault. Once the cause of the failure has
been identified and resolved, a restart of the MotoSuiveur® System is required.
After a successful self-test following a reset of MotoSuiveur® System, it enters
in following mode.

In addition to the maximum permissible crane speed, the MS also monitors
for unwanted movement. Unwanted movement means movement of the load
without a movement request. When such movement is detected, the MC
triggers, enters in fault state and prevents hoist movements. After
entering in fault state, an operator response is required to identify
the cause of the fault. Once the cause of the failure has been
identified and resolved, a restart of the MotoSuiveur® System is required (Section
6.3). After a successful self-test of the MotoSuiveur® System after a reset, it
enters following mode.

All operation (Section 5.2) and fault states (Section 7) are displayed
on MS Controller 7 – segment display.

RESET

**FAULTS**
==========

*Any faults that occur during MS operation are displayed on the HMI
screen (if installed) and on the 7-segment display of the MS controller.
Each fault is characterized by a number and a description. Faults are
divided into two groups - system faults and MS faults. System faults are
those that are related to the electrical performance of the MS
controller. MS faults are related to the working process of the MS
unit.*

Faults and warnings displayed on MS 7 – segment controller indicates all
types of MS warnings/faults and MS controller internal errors.
Indication is a combination of letters and numbers.

MS controller internal faults are indicated with blinked combination of
|A red number on a white background Description automatically generated
with medium confidence|, number and finish with symbol |A picture
containing screenshot, graphics, font, graphic design Description
automatically generated|.

MS faults are displayed with combination of |image40| and number. MS
warnings are displayed with combination of |A red number on a white
background Description automatically generated with medium confidence|
and number.

On figure 13 a) is shown example for internal MS controller fault. On
figure 13 b) is shown example for MS warning.

Lubrication 
------------

All Motosuiveur® units, are checked after assembly, set and tested on a
bench at Siguren.

During these tests, the oil tank is filled, the level is adjusted and
the hydraulic system is drained.

After the torque arm is set-up:

-  If necessary clean the upper side of the Motosuiveur®.

-  Unscrew the breather cap and check the oil level. (See Nameplate on
   MS4 for fill capacity)

-  Replace the breather cap and screw back tightly.

Draining the Hydraulic System
-----------------------------

After each operation of the Motosuiveur® an auto diagnostic programme is
run to check that there is no air within the damping chamber. If air is
detected, the damping chamber **MUST** be drained. This operation must
be carried out by a qualified operator.

Procedure:

- Ensure the hoist is empty

- Ensure the oil level is sufficient

- Make a movement down at slow speed until the movement stops (the
MS Torque Limiter is slipping)

- Make a movement up at slow speed until the movement stops (the torque
limiter is slipping)

- Repeat these two operations seven times

- Power on the Motosuiveur® (an automatic auto diagnostic is launched)

- If the auto diagnostic ends with a fault, repeat the procedure
