Technical description :
=======================

-  Zero modification to existing barrels

-  Compact design

-  Low height of axis

-  Easy deactivation (for maintenance, etc.) by removing the worm gear

Installation :
--------------

-  Prior to remove the existing plummer block, make one rotation and
   find by comparator the 2 points on the barrel side flange that are on
   the same axial plane on the diameter of the future pin and bolts
   diameter. These two points will receive the bolt holes,

-  Remove the existing plummer block,

-  Put the transmission flange on the barrel shaft (fitted assembly) and
   use the holes to counter-drill holes on the barrel side flange,

-  Mount the transmission flange on the MS wheel (bolts, pins),

-  Assemble the flanged MS to the side flange of the barrel. The washers
   create a gap which allows the MS to be strictly aligned with the
   barrel (shaft) axis. The MS wheel and flange are fitted to the
   existing barrel shaft so the MS is strictly concentric to the barrel.

Thus :
------

-  The vertical load is taken by the shaft, as before, but the
   transmission flange helps also,

-  The bolts are just holding the parts together, practically no forces
   to transmit,

-  In case of braking, all the torque is transmitted to the barrel via
   the pins,

-  The transmission flange creates a redundant load path, so the « shaft
   break » scenario becomes highly improbable
