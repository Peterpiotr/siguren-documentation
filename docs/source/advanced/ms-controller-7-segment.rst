Display of faults/warnings
===========================

.. include:: /_img/_image-substitutions.rst

Any faults/warnings that occur during MS operation are displayed :

    - on the 7-segment display of the MS Controller,
    - on the HMI screen (if installed). 

Each fault is characterized by a number and a description. 

Faults are divided into two groups: 

    - **System faults** are related to the electrical performance of the MS Controller.
    - **MotoSuiveur速 System faults** are related to operating of the MS Unit.

.. the names of the two fault groups are not different nor explicit enough


Faults and warnings displayed on MS 7-segment display of the controller indicate all types of MotoSuiveur速 System warnings/faults and MS Controller internal errors. 
Indication is a combination of letters and numbers. 

**MS Controller internal faults** are indicated with a blinking combination of:

    |7s-E| + NUMBER + END symbol |7s-039|.
