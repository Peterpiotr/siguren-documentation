===================================================================================================
Back-up by manual action of the service brake and manual rotation of the Motosuiveur procedure
===================================================================================================

This procedure has to be followed in case of one Motosuiveur® motor is defective.

The lowering movement is controlled manually by the operator, through the handle at the
Motosuiveur® shaft.

This procedure is practically identical to *that described above*. 
The only difference occurs in step 5 where the operator 1 should place the crank of MS on the screw and follow manually 
(unlike the previous case where tracking was performed using the control box).

.. note::
  | We have to take care to switch off the Motosuiveur® cabinet.
  | Each of the two operators can stop the operation: the first operator by closing the service brake, the second operator by stopping the rotation of MS.
  | During this procedure, the lowering is controlled by the operator on the service brake. The other operator follows the movement and can always stop it.

     - 4.	Repeat steps 1 to 4 of the previous procedure (procedure 2.1)
   * - **5**
     - The operator n°1 opens the service brake step by step (to allow the lowering of the load by gravity without exceeding a certain speed, in which case the MS blocks). 
       Meanwhile, the other operator n°2 should follow the movement by rotating the handle
