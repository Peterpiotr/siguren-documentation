=====================================
Back-up by forced lowering procedure
=====================================

This procedure has to be done in case of the main kinematic chain is not available (gearbox or transmission shaft breakage).

.. note::
  | To carry out this procedure, you must provide a mechanism to drive the MS worm. 
  | This mechanism should produce a high enough torque to move the load (taking into account the weight of the load and the various specific frictions due to this type of recovery). 
  | For example, we can use a motor and a reducer adapted.
  | Only one operator is needed for this procedure.

.. warning::
  This procedure has to be done as a last resort. 
  The other back-up procedures have to be prioritised because, in the forced lowering, the worm and the wheel are worn quickly.

   * - **1**
     - Switch off the Motosuiveur® cabinet.
   * - **2**
     - Remove the worm cover.
   * - **3**
     - Set up the drive mechanism on the MS worm and start process at lower speed.

     - As soon as the load is safe (on the ground or an adapted structure), inspect the Motosuiveur® (worm and wheel) and the crane.
