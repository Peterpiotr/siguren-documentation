   controller
        also called 'drive' or 'servo-drive'
        SMD servo drives are especially suitable for high dynamics and high precision.
        They integrate the power supply, the braking resistor, the mains filter and the safety function. 
        Thanks to their integrated inputs/outputs and PLC functions, they are suitable for a wide variety of applications.
        Industrial Ethernet communication busses provide networked configurations. The user-friendly Windows-based parameterization software 
        offers functions for easy setup and diagnostics.
