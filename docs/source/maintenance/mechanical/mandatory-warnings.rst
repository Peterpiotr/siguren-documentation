Warnings (Health and Safety, Warranty, ...)
============================================

.. These warnings are collected from all over the documentation. they will be made consistent and redistributed in the modern documentation.

Due to inherent dangers in the maintenance and testing of electrical equipment, special attention should
be paid to safety, not only to the personnel working the immediate area but also to equipment under test,
maintenance and repair.

All personnel operating in the relevant area should observe these procedures and pay due regard to
safety Local Safety Rules and Regulations.

It is advisable that at least two fully trained engineers be present at all times when the equipment is being
tested, maintained or serviced.

All equipment under electrical test should have :guilabel:`‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING NOTICES` displayed saying that equipment
tests are in progress. Any ancillary equipment, for example, test equipment and instruments, should be
safe and prominent notices around the equipment should advertise any danger, which may exist. Any
notices displayed in pursuing these procedures should be removed as soon as they are no longer
applicable, to emphasise the special significance of their presence.

.. important::
    If it becomes necessary to carry out maintenance, testing or setting up to work on the equipment requiring
    access by opening doors, removing covers etc., then safety hazards may arise. Then risk assessments
    should be carried out and safe-working practices followed.

.. important::
    The user should ensure that maintenance setting up and authorised and competent persons only carry out
    testing of the equipment. The following basic rules should be adhered to: 

        - Before commencing maintenance works, the supply to the equipment must be **isolated, locked off and the appropriate safety documents issued**.
        - Comply with safe working conditions, Local Safety Rules and Regulations.
        - **Do not work** on the equipment when it is :guilabel:`‚ö° energized`.
        - Ensure that all persons working on the equipment are familiar with :guilabel:`üïÆ instructions` and :guilabel:`‚ÑπÔ∏è information` provided.
        - Providing that the equipment is functioning correctly and all personnel responsible for operating it are complying with the conditions specified, 
          the electrical equipment may be deemed to be "properly used" and should be safe and free from health hazards.

.. important::
  FOR ALL MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES, ENSURE POWER TO MACHINE IS ISOLATED

.. important::
  FOR ALL MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES, MAINTENANCE STAFF MUST BE TRAINED AND COMPETENT TO MAINTAIN / SERVICE THE EQUIPMENT BEFORE WORK COMMENCES.

.. important::
  FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE ABOVE MAY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH.

Maintenance **MUST** be completed by **SIGUREN Technologies LTD or authorised service centers**, the units are sealed and **MUST not** be opened by unauthorised persons. 

.. important::
  Visual checks of the the unit MUST carried out at least annually.


.. warning::
    Read the safety precautions before you start any operational or service work:

The Motosuiveur¬Æ System is designed to resist the dynamic force of a defined application.

Before Motosuiveur¬Æ System is put into operation, make sure that the installation complies entirely with the application which the Motosuiveur¬Æ 
has been designed for.

Before any operation on the Motosuiveur¬Æ System, switch off the electrical supply and ensure that the load cannot move.

Never place your hands inside the Motosuiveur¬Æ Unit, unless you are sure that it is impossible to rotate the shaft.

Never rotate the Motosuiveur¬Æ Unit if the maintenance door is open or/and if the protection cover of the torque limiter is removed.

Do not modify Motosuiveur¬Æ System! Any modification of the kinematic chain increasing the inertias, the limiter adjustments or the maximum speeds can be dangerous.

All work must be carried out by competent staff with appropriate training.

SIGUREN Technologies declines any responsibility if the safety instructions are not followed correctly!

Motosuiveur¬Æ System is designed to work with lifting equipment and must only be used with the applications they have been ordered and designed for.

Using the device beyond its technical capabilities will cause the device to fail or malfunction.

.. warning::
    The following scenarios should be avoided as this may invalidate the warranty:

        -	See Warranties and Guarantees for further information.
        -	Incorrect use of the Motosuiveur¬Æ System.
        -	An unapproved modification of the Motosuiveur¬Æ System.
        -	Incorrect handling or work on the Motosuiveur¬Æ System.

.. warning::
    RISK OF DEATH OR INJURY MAY OCCUR IF THE EQUIPMENT IS IN CONTACT WITH HIGH VOLTAGE POWER LINES AND WIRED COMPONENTS. 
    TO PREVENT PHYSICAL INJURY OR MATERIAL DAMAGE, ONLY TRAINED AND QUALIFIED STAFF ARE AUTHORIZED TO WORK ON THE EQUIPMENT.

.. warning::
    DAMAGE MAY OCCUR IF:
    - THE MOTOSUIVEUR¬Æ IS NOT USED COMPLYING WITH THE APPLICATION IT HAS BEENDESIGNED FOR,
    - IF THE MOTOSUIVEUR¬Æ HAS BEEN MODIFIED
    - IF THE SAFETY STANDARDS AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT OBSERVED.


.. warning::
    DO NOT UNPLUG ELECTRIC FUNCTIONS, DO NOT PERFORM MAINTENANCE, REPAIR OR ASSEMBLE ANYTHING ON THE EQUIPMENT WHEN IT IS SWITCHED ON.
    THE LINKING CABLES MUST NOT BE SUBJECTED TO MECHANICAL EFFORTS.
