Inspecting and Measuring MS Torque Limiter 
===========================================

General Visual Inspection
==========================

Steps
    1. The operating area should be examined for contamination such as dust and fibres which may indicate the TL has been subject to forces which are causing the TL to slip and slipping will lead to the wear of the linings.
    2. The TL should be examined to assess if the unit is clean, dry and without signs of any possible contamination which may alter the performance through the contamination of the friction linings.
    3. Signs of movement on shafts, 
    4. Condition of link chain (corrosion), 
    5. Wear of tooth profile where the link chain interfaces with the hubs.
    
    .. no more link chain obviously

    

Measuring Friction Linings
==========================

Steps
    1. Measure the thicknes of the linings.
 
        .. how?

    2. The TL friction linings have a minimum thickness of 2mm. 
       
        .. important:: 
            Replacement is necessary if this limit is reached.

    

Validating Slippage Torque
===========================

Steps
    1. Measure the slippage torque

        .. how?

    2. Ensure MS Torque Limiter slips when specified torque setting is exceeded.

        .. What if it does not
