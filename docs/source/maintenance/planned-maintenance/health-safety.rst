.. warning::
    Read health and safety precautions before you start any service
    work. Servicing of the equipment must only be carried-out by
    authorised persons fully trained and competent in the maintenance of
    scx special projects equipment. They must fully understand and
    adopt correct and safe working practices.

If you are unable to carry out the work safely in the required manner then contact SCX Special Projects
Ltd for advice. Only routine servicing procedures are detailed in this handbook. Do not attempt more
complex work without reference to SCX Special Projects Ltd.

.. warning::
    Please read the health and safety instructions in section 2 before carrying out any work on the hhs.

There is no single factor more important than minimising the possibility of personal injury to the Operator
and/or those working in the area, or damage to property, equipment and/or materials.

No Operator should be permitted to use the equipment unless they are familiar with its operations. They
should be physically and mentally fit and trained in Safe Hoisting Practices. Hazards can only be
minimised by, care, common sense and the operator being alert at all times.
