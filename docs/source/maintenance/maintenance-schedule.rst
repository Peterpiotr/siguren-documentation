    * - 
      - Maintenance interval
      - Operation
    * - General installation
      - Weekly
      - General inspection, signs of movement on shafts, condition of link chain (corrosion), 
        wear of tooth profile where the link chain interfaces with the hubs.
    * - Friction linings
      - 6 Monthly
      - The TL friction linings have a minimum thickness of 2mm.Replacement is
        necessary if this limit is reached.
    * - Operating area
      - Weekly
      - The operating area should be examined for contamination such as dust and
        fibres which may indicate the TL has been subject to forces which are causing
        the TL to slip and slipping will lead to the wear of the linings. The TL should be
        examined to assess if the unit is clean, dry and without signs of any possible
        contamination which may alter the performance through the contamination of
        the friction linings.
    * - Torque slip test
      - Annually
      - To ensure torque limiter slips when specified torque setting is exceeded.
