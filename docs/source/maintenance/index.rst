.. admonition:: Proposed Procedures
  :class: note

  - Run MS Self-test and read results
  - Consult warnings history
  - Measure MS arrest torque on installed MS
  - Inspecting the oil level
  - Changing the oil
  - Inspecting the grease quality
  - Changing the grease
  - Changing the belt
  - Inspecting MS fixation to barrel and to hoist structure 
  - Replacing Worm Outer Piston Assembly
  - Replacing Wheel Lip Seal
  - Replacing O-Rings 
  - Inspecting MS IRD fixation to MS Unit
  - Inspecting MS IRD transmission grease
  - Testing MS IRD mechanical engagement

.. inspecting, testing, replacing and such must be used precisely and consistently

.. the /maintenance section should be subdivided first based on user actions/moments in the lifecycle and second according to MS System components
    visual inspections
    part replacements
    testing 
    consulting MS data
    etc
