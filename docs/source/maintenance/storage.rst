Storage
============

In order to ensure good preservation conditions the following storage recommendations should be
observed:
(In case of ship transportation, the packaging must be waterproof and have a humidity absorbing
properties). The equipment must also be stored in a dry place, away from adverse weather conditions and
any temperature variation ensuring it is placed on an insulated paper covered wooden base.

.. rubric:: Short Period Storage (Less Than 3 Months)

    After the tests and the final checks, the manufactured parts of the Motosuiveur® must be protected with a
    long term corrosion preventative coating. The oil fill up must be adjusted to the level indicator. In this
    condition, they can be stored in vertical position, without any intervention during 3
    months. Beware not to damage the protected finish.

.. rubric:: Medium Period Storage (Less Than 1 Year)

    For a storage period of 3 to 12 months, the Motosuiveur® must be completely filled with the oil designed
    for the required application.
    This oil will be drained off to the level indicator before use. There will be no need to rinse it. During
    emptying, beware not to go under the level indicator otherwise the system may need to be drained.

.. rubric:: Long Period Storage (Less Than 5 Years)

    For a storage period longer than 12 months, to 5 years, it is recommended to drain the Motosuiveur® then
    pour or spray ARDROX IV 2 (supplier Brent) into the machine (5 % of the total volume).
    
    - This is a volatile corrosion inhibitor additive for standard lubricating oils.
    - Its vapour phase protects surfaces which are not in contact with the liquid phase.
    - Its liquid phase increases the corrosion protection properties of the oil in which it is dissolved.

.. rubric:: For A Medium or a Long Period of Storage

    With the corrosion inhibitors being volatile during the storage period make sure the inside of the
    Motosuiveur® is insulated/protected against any atmospheric. In particular, the breather caps must be
    replaced by hermetic caps. The maintenance door must be hermetically closed.
    
    Every 3 months:

    - Rotate the PV wheel (at least 1 turn) manually.
    - Check the protective long term corrosion protective surface.

.. rubric:: Protection of the Manufactured Parts

    The manufactured surfaces are delivered protected by a long term corrosion preventative coating
    (standard casing). Except if there is some deterioration to the surface, there is no need for another
    protective coating application.
    Prior to coating the product has been Grit Blast cleaned in accordance with ISO 8501-1:2007
    to grade Sa2½.
