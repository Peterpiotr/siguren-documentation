MotoSuiveur® User Documentation
===============================

**MotoSuiveur® Solutions** are hoist safety solutions designed to actively permit only safe operation, 
and instantly default to a safe arrested state when hoisting is disrupted.

.. note::

   This documentation is under active development.

How-Tos
===========

.. important::
    How-Tos are linear procedures aiming to take the user from a given situation he might encounter and recognize to a desired outcome. This desired outcome may (but not necessarily) be "MS ready 
    to follow".
    
    The titles of these procedures must clearly reflect their intended outcome (the issue they are solving for the user). 

    "Activate Back-up Mode" for example does not take the user to a clear desired outcome, "Using the MS load recovery capabilities" does not either. However "Recover suspended load with MS-Backed Gravity Lowering"
    is clearly identifiable by the user as a procedure to follow to get a desired outcome.
    

.. note::
    List of expected How-Tos, The titles are not defintive:

    * Unlock hoist motion on installed MS by disassembling worm
    * Assemble Worm on installed MS
    * Run MS Self-test and read results
    * Consult warnings history
    * Measure MS arrest torque on installed MS
    * Recover suspended load with MS Integrated Load Recovery
    * Recover suspended load with MS-Backed Gravity Lowering
    * Recover suspended load with MS Portable Recovery Tool
    * Replace MS Oil
    * Replace xx part
    * Perform visual check of MS
