All MotoSuiveur® are checked after assembly, set and tested on bench. During those tests, the oil filling up is adjusted and the hydraulic system is drained. 

To prevent draining again the system on activation, the MotoSuiveur® must be handled in the position shown in the illustration below, with the cap in top position.

Before any handling, check:

    - The correct balancing of the load,
    - The handling equipment capacity and compare it to the load to lift.
    - That the slings and straps do not lean on fragile parts (pipes, diverse accessories, etc.) and that they do not damage the surface treatment applied on our products.

.. warning::
    Never lift a MotoSuiveur® hanged by the motor.
