Handling the MS Unit
==============================

Orientation
============

.. note::
	From **User Manual-7.4.doc**

 The MS Unit must be transported in the authorized positions shown above in *figure 4*.

.. important::
    Before setting it up, check the way the MotoSuiveurÂ® is positioned the right way according to the supplied mounting drawing.

.. keep the above?

All MS Units are controlled after assembly, set and tested on bench. During those tests, the oil fill is adjusted.

For Hydraulic MS Units, the damping chamber is bled and sealed. 
However, a certain quantity of air remains in the rest of the system. 
To prevent the air from penetrating inside the damping chamber during transportation, the Hydraulic Damping MS Units (MSH) must be carried with the damping chamber in specific position.

.. how about Friction MS Units and their grease

Oil sensor (2) or breather cap (3) are oriented up and oil drain hole (4) down.
