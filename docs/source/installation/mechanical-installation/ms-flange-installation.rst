Pin flange
============

Steps
	1. Make one rotation and find by comparator the 2 points on the drum side flange that are on the same axial plane on the diameter of the future pin and bolts diameter. 
			
			.. clarify.

			- These two points will receive the bolt holes.

	3. Put the transmission flange on the barrel shaft (fitted assembly) and use the holes to counter-drill holes on the barrel side flange,
	4. Mount the transmission flange on the MS wheel (bolts, pins),
	5. Assemble the flanged MS to the side flange of the barrel. The washers create a gap which allows the MS to be strictly aligned with the barrel (shaft) axis. The MS wheel and flange are fitted to the existing barrel shaft so the MS is strictly concentric to the barrel.

Flat-sided flange
==================

Steps
	2. If the flat sides are not parallel, rotate the barrel.
	
	.. note::
		If you cannot rotate the barrel, do the following:

		1. Remove this plug.
		
		..

		2. Put the allen key S12 in the hole. Minimum length of 150 mm

		..

		3. Rotate the worm with the allen key in the ANTICLOCKWISE direction.

	.. warning::
		If you rotate the worm in CLOCKWISE direction there is a possibility of blocking the MS. 
		If this happens, please consult :doc:`Unblocking the MotoSuiveur® Unit <../../advanced/unblocking-ms>`


	2. Assemble the MS to the drum and secure it with the bolts M16.

	.. note::
		At this point, the hoist gearbox may also be assembled to the opposite end of the drum (depending on Demag drum replacement procedure). 

	3. Insert the centering bush.
