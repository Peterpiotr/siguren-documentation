Installation Safety of MotoSuiveur® System
==========================================

Compliance
===========

The MotoSuiveur® System is designed to resist the dynamic solicitations of a defined application. Before any putting in operation, 
make sure that the installation complies entirely with the application which the MotoSuiveur® System has been ordered for. 
In particular, check if the MS Unit serial N° given on the specification nameplate is the same as the one on the plan.

.. important::
	Before any operation on the equipment, switch off the electrical supply and ensure that the load cannot move!

.. important::
	Never place your hands inside the MS Unit, without being sure that the rotation of the shafts is impossible!

.. important::
	Never rotate the MS Unit if any of covers is open or/and if the protection cover of the MS Torque Limiter is removed (OPTION)!

.. important::
	Do not modify the machine.  Any modification of the kinematic chain increasing the inertias, 
	the limiter adjustments (OPTION) or the maximum speeds can be dangerous!

.. important::
	All work must be carried out by competent staff with an appropriate training! 

Environment
=============

A MotoSuiveur® System is a safety organ, thus it needs regular surveillance interventions and operating in urgency situations. 
So it has to be easily accessible. 

In particular, the following conditions are required:

- Allow handling.
- Ensure accessibility.
- Ensure the safety of the maintenance and surveillance staff.
- Insulate the sequipment of a too polluting environment.
- Allow a normal air admission necessary to a good thermal exchange.
- Ensure acceptable ambient temperature (from 0° C to 45° C for the standard version).
- A sheltered working location.
- Ensure that using the handle is easy and can be done in sufficient safety conditions.
- The electric boxed set containing the operating console must be easy to reach. It is better if it is next to the MS Unit and visible by an operator located near the handle. If it is not feasible, install a buzzer near the MS Unit to gravity lowering operations with the service brake.
- Make sure that the electric cables between the MotoSuiveur® Control Cabinet and the electric boxed set are not subject to chemical or mechanical aggressions. 
- Make sure that no heat source is in direct contact with the MotoSuiveur®.
- The MS Unit must be filled with the appropriate type of oil.

Installation steps
===================

For a fine installation of the MotoSuiveur® System and to avoid ill-timed blockings during the setting of the command station and of the drives, 
we advise users to start the winch assembly by following these steps:

- Mounting of the MS Torque Limiter (OPTION).
- Setting and testing of the lifting drive and the command cabinet.
- Installation of the MotoSuiveur® on the drum and its reaction arm.
- Positionning of the manual commands.
- Oil level check.
- Electric linking of the MotoSuiveur® Control Cabinet.
