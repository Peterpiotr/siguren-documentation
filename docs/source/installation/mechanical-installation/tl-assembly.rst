==================================
Installing an MS Torque Limiter 
==================================

.. note::
	From **User Manual-7.4.doc**

.. important::
    Assembly must be done by qualified operators.

The MS Torque Limiter is delivered factory rated to the value necessary for the application. 
In case of doubt, check the application data on the assembly drawing.
The MS Torque Limiter assembly direction is defined on the layout.

The MS Torque Limiter coupling is made of:

    - a permanent spring limiter
    - a duplex coupling chain
    - a driving hub

.. should use numbers to refer to illustration

    MS Torque Limiter

The cylinder of the limiter part contains helical springs which create the pressure force applied to the friction linings.

    MS Torque Limiter - Limiter part

The response curve of the helical springs allows to keep, without much fluctuation, the pressure force applied to the linings. 
Thus, **no matter their degree of wear**, the fluctuation of the pre-set torque is insignificant.
It is the number of springs which defines the rating torque.

.. warning::
    | The MS Torque Limiter being delivered is rated for the application; the limiter part should never be dismantled. 
    | Never add nor withdraw a spring during normal functioning of the winch. 
    | Any maintenance operation should be done by SIGUREN technologies or an authorized representative
