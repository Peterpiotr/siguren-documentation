Setting and testing the drive
=================================

.. note::
	Source: :download:`User Manual-7.4.doc`

It is preferable that before the MotosuiveurÂ® is assembled, settings and tests are performed on the hoist drives:

    - the acceleration ramps
    - the deceleration ramps
    - the opening of the service brake against the motor torque
    - the closing of the service brake against the motor speed
    - the thresholds of the fixed speeds
    - the minimum and maximum speeds

The Motosuiveur is programmed to brake as soon as the maximum and minimum thresholds are exceeded for each of these values. 

.. important::
    If when engaged the drive is NOT correctly set, the Motosuiveur will automatically brake, until the good value is obtained.
