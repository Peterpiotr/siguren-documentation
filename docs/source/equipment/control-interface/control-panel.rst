Control panel
==============

Layout of the control panel is defined according to pre-selected functionality relative to the MS Block Diagram. 
The control panel can be located on the control cabinet front door, can be external or a combination of both.
The operator has the facility to use the controls via switches or MSHMI.
The switches and HMI can be used to switch the operating modes of the MotoSuiveur system.
Combination of active (ON) and inactive (OFF) signal lams gives current status of MotoSuiveur. 


Front door panel layout
======================

The control panel contains indicators and control switches. They are divided into two groups: mandatory and optional.

Mandatory_ are:

- Hoist Enabled
- Fault
- Reset

The figure below shows an example overview of a control panel with and without MSHMI.

.. _Mandatory:
Mandatory signals and controls
==============================

Hoist enabled
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:guilabel:`🟢 Hoist enabled indicator` indicate that the MotoSuiveur authorizes hoist movements. (figure 5).

Hoist enabled signal will be **ON** only in case if **ON** signal from hoist is **ON**.

Hoist enabled signal will be **ON** when :doc:`../operating-instructions/self-test` procedure passes successfully and **ON** signal is available.
Then :guilabel:`🟢 Hoist enabled indicator` and :guilabel:`⚪ Healthy indicator` are **ON**. 
The signals are indicating ``system ready`` (``MotoSuiveur ready``).



Fault 
^^^^^^

:guilabel:`🔴 Fault indicator` indicates three different types of faults:

	- MotoSuiveur controller internal errors, described in section ????;
	- MotoSuiveur faults (further called flt_num), described in section ????;
	- MotoSuiveur warnings (further called wrn_num), described in section ???;

MotoSuiveur :term:`controller` internal errors are related to MotoSuiveur controller internal hardware, firmware, and MotoSuiveur motor. 
This type of errors are with highest priority. 
If MotoSuiveur controller internal fault appear further operation is prohibited.
	
.. note::	
 	:guilabel:`🔴 Fault indicator` is **ON** during MotoSuiveur self-test.

.. warning:: 
	The system displays only last MotoSuiveur warning (``wrn_num``) or MotoSuiveur fault (``flt_num``) occurred.

Faults and warnings are displayed on MotoSuiveur controller integrated 7-segment display. 
The display indicates all types of MotoSuiveur warnings/faults and MotoSuiveur controller internal errors. 
Indication is a combination of letters and numbers.
MotoSuiveur controller internal faults are indicated with blinked combination of |image035|, number and finish with symbol |image039|.

MotoSuiveur faults are displayed with combination of |image036| and number. 
MotoSuiveur warnings are displayed with combination of |image035| and number. 


Reset 
^^^^^^

:guilabel:`🔘 Reset button` reset MotoSuiveur system electrically and mechanically. After reset, MotoSuiveur system is performing self-test.
