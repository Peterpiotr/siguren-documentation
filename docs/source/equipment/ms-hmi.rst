Advantages of using MSHMI to operate with MotoSuiveur are:

	- Display MotoSuiveur status information in the form of messages, event listings, graphics and numerical values;
	- Change the MotoSuiveur configuration. Configuration has a secure access code at different levels;
	- Change operating mode of MotoSuiveur;
	- Display maintenance information of MotoSuiveur.

.. note::
    MSHMI is not part of standard MS equipment and can be ordered additionally.
