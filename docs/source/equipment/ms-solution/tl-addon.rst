MS Torque Limiter Add-On
======================
.. note::
 The MS Torque Limiter is mounted between the hoist main electric motor and the high-speed reducer shaft of the hoist. 
 
 The MS Torque Limiter is delivered factory rated to the value necessary to the application.

The MS Torque Limiter coupling is made of friction linings (2) and springs (1) set to drive the coupling which is attached to the motor shaft. 

Slip Torque
===========

MS Torque Limiters are set to slip at a nominal value of 110% SWL. The response curve of the helical springs is maintained, 
and the pressure force applied to the linings is constant regardless of the degree of wear. 

Any fluctuation of the pre-set torque is insignificant, and it is the number of springs which defines the rating torque. 
This makes MS Torque Limiters the most reliable and efficient means of protection against overloads in hoists.
