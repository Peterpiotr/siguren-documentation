Component description
======================

Nameplate
----------

The nameplate of the MotoSuiveur Unit indicates the maximum rotating speed (1), 
the corresponding braking torque (2) and other characteristics (mass (3), oil quantity (4), etc…)

The MotoSuiveur is designed to resist the dynamic solicitations **of a defined application**; so before any putting in operation, 
make sure that the installation complies entirely with the application that the Motosuiveur® have been ordered by checking the nameplate.

.. warning::
    | The Motosuiveur is factory set taking into account the speed, load and inertia of the equipment. 
    | Increasing the speed / inertia of the equipment on which the Motosuiveur is installed is not allowed and may lead to serious damage. 





Interface with hoist
======================

The :mechpart:`worm wheel` is single-helix.

I have footnoted a first item [#f1]_ and second item [#f2]_.
This also references the second item [#f2]_.

Manual command handle (wrench)
===============================

.. note::
	Source: :download:`User Manual-7.4.doc`

The manual operation devices allow the Motosuiveur® to set-down the load in case of a breakdown (gravity lowering). 
The operating procedure is described in *chapter 5*.

    Manual command handle

For example, the manual command handle can be composed of a standard speed handle (square ¾ “) (1), a socket universal (2) and a socket (3).

.. important::
    It must be used by operators informed of procedures.

It is to be used only in case of gravity lowering with manual control from the Motosuiveur®, for example in case of power failure of the electric supply of the Motosuiveur®.
