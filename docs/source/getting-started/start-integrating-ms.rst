	Mechanical advantages of the new assembly
	===========================================
..
	- The vertical load is taken by the shaft, as before, but the transmission flange helps also,
	- The bolts are just holding the parts together, practically no forces to transmit,
	- In case of braking, all the torque is transmitted to the barrel via the pins,
	- The transmission flange creates a redundant load path, so the « shaft break » scenario becomes highly improbable
